# EU guide to monitoring Beach macro litter 2023 : chapter 3 - Beach macro litter monitoring

## Introduction

Within the MSFD (Directive 2008/56/EC) and Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848, criterion D10C1 has been itter on the
coastline, in the surface layer of the water column, and on the seabed, are at levels that do not cause harm to the
coastal and marine MSFD requires, when feasible, the collection of information on the sources and pathways of marine
litter to pinpoint the prioritisation and elaboration of targeted prevention, reduction and mitigation measures. In
addition to identifying tailor-made management approaches, the MSFD requires assessment of their effectiveness to feed
into the decision-making process of the subsequent MSFD implementation cycles.

In September 2020, the Commission published a threshold value for marine macro litter (> 2.5 cm) on coastline, paving
the way for reducing harm to European regional seas from beach litter to a sufficiently precautionary level. EU M
experts have agreed that the median value of beach litter within a country subregion has to be less than 20 items per
100 m of coastline to stay under the threshold as part of GES for marine litter (van Loon et al., 2020). The reduction
of beach litter in Europe in order to move towards achieving GES requires a combination of efforts at different levels.
These include legislative measures at the EU level, such as the European Plastics Strategy (European Commission, 2018),
the Single-Use Plastics Directive (11), the Water and Waste policies, the Green Deal and the Circular Economy Action
Plans; measures in the context of the European Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans against marine litter;
national initiatives ranging from the country level to the municipality levels, including awareness-raising targeting
different societal actors.

### Background and state of the art

Beach surveys for macro litter assessment are the most common marine litter monitoring (Ryan et al., 2009). Litter
monitoring on the European Regional seas coasts has developed from several community-based campaigns, mostly of NGOs
(Galgani et al., 2013). Originally designed to heighten public awareness or make a simple assessment of the magnitude of
the problem, they have developed over the past 40 years into a tool for monitoring litter washed ashore and/or deposited
on beaches (e.g. Schulz et al., 2015). In 2013, the MSFD TG ML published operational guidelines on how to monitor beach
macro litter on the European coastline to address the need for obtaining harmonised beach macro litter data and support
Member States in setting up their beach macro litter monitoring programmes (Galgani et al., 2013). Indeed, the
comparison of beach litter data among assessment programmes and Member State is one of the aims of the MSFD. While some
Member State already have beach litter monitoring programmes in place (e.g. countries in the Helsinki Commission
(HELCOM) region and those in the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic
(OSPAR) region; Schulz et al., 2013; HELCOM 2020), other countries only recently started to set up their marine litter
monitoring programmes within the context of the MSFD (e.g. Italy; see Fortibuoni et al., 2021).

Most beach litter protocols that were used on European coasts during the first MSFD cycle focused on the collection and
visual identification and classification of litter items found at shoreline sites. However, the protocols applied in
some countries differed in terms of sampling units (type, size and positioning criteria), frequency and timing of the
surveys, size limits for and classes of litter items to be surveyed, classification lists and quantification units
(number, weight or volume of items per stretch of coastline or per surface area of coastline) (Hanke et al., 2019). The
application of several protocols between and within European Regional seas made it difficult to compare data.

In 2017, within the TG ML and with the support of EMODnet, the first pan-European beach litter dataset for 2012-2016 was
compiled and analysed to derive baselines for the MSFD (Hanke et al., 2019). The analysis involved data from 22 European
countries and four marine regions. Data from 3063 surveys performed on 389 European beaches were considered. The biggest
challenge faced during the data compilation phase was dealing with the heterogeneity of data formats, data quality and
protocols used during the beach surveys. The outcomes of this analysis were considered in the revision of the beach
macro litter monitoring guidance. One 
of the key findings was that five litter item classification lists were used, each featuring different levels of litter
item category aggregations and total category numbers (Hanke et al., 2019). In response, the Joint List of Litter
Categories for Marine Macrolitter Monitoring was prepared by the TG ML in close collaboration with Member States and the
RSCs (Fleet et al., 2021). This list is based on a hierarchical system that facilitates the recording of litter items at
different levels of detail. This enables the compatibility and comparability of results obtained through different
marine litter recording schemes used for beach litter or those performed in other compartments of the marine environment
(Fleet et al., 2021). The benefits of comparable data (also linked to the implementation of large-scale policy measures
against litter) are evident. Indeed, in recent years, cooperation among the RSCs and the EU Member States led to a
better harmonisation of data collected under different policy and legislative frameworks; a comparison of the latest
versions of the different protocols (Table 3.1) shows an overall alignment of the most critical aspects, even if there
is still room for improvement and additional efforts are needed. This chapter represents a further step towards
harmonising the monitoring of litter on the coastline among Member States and the RSCs.

### Scope

The TG ML has evaluated existing methods for monitoring litter on the coastline regarding their capacity to meet the
MSFD requirements. The TG ML recommends a harmonised method that can be applied to assess beach litter in all European
Regional seas, thus ensuring the consistency, compatibility, and comparability of monitoring data from coastal
assessments of litter within and among regions. In this chapter, the methodology for conducting beach macro litter
surveys within the MSFD is thoroughly described, and QA/QC aspects are addressed. In addition, an overview of other
beach macro litter survey methods is presented.

### Definitions and terminology

* Macro litter. Litter items larger than 25 mm in the longest dimension, with no set upper limit.
* Mesolitter. Litter items from 5 mm to 25 mm in the longest dimension.

## Marine Strategy Framework Directive methods for beach macro litter surveys

Capitalising upon the lessons learned from implementing the first MSFD cycle, the following protocol for carrying out
beach macro litter monitoring has evolved.

### Survey site selection

Survey sites should, whenever possible, have the following characteristics:

* a minimum length of 100 m along the water edge (i.e. sufficient to have at least one sampling unit);
* composed of sand or gravel;
* low to moderate slope;
* clear access to the sea (not blocked by breakwaters or jetties);
* accessible to survey teams year-round.

Within the above constraints, the location of survey sites should be spatially stratified to reflect:

* different pressures and different levels of exposure to litter (e.g. close to river mouths, close to harbours/marinas,
presence of touristic facilities nearby);
* different development and urbanisation levels, including a balanced mix of urban, semi-urban, and remote/natural beaches.

The survey sites should be the same as those monitored in the first MSFD cycle to compare results over time. It is
possible to replace one or more of the survey sites among those monitored until 2020, but only in the case of profound
changes that make it impossible to monitor a site indefinitely (destruction of the coast, new positioning of
breakwaters, inaccessibility, etc.). Changes should be kept to a minimum, and, where possible, the new monitored survey
sites should have the same characteristics as the original ones. New survey sites can be established, by applying the
selection criteria above, if this increases the representativeness of beaches at the country-region level. It is of
utmost importance that the characteristics of their survey sites and any changes in the characteristics are recorded and
saved for future reference (see below and Annex I Survey site (beach) Identity Form ).

There is no agreed statistical method for recommending a minimum number of survey sites represent a certain length of
coast, a specific region or a country. It depends on the purpose of the monitoring, the geomorphology of the coast, the
number of sites available that meet the criteria presented above, and trade- offs between available resources and
monitoring needs. The sampling effort necessary to assess litter concentrations within a given region is, for instance,
dependent on the desired level of detection (i.e. to detect small-scale spatial differences in litter quantity and
composition, more sampling sites are required) and the heterogeneity of pressures.

It is proposed that beach litter surveys should be performed in at least four survey sites within a country- subregion
(e.g. France western Mediterranean Sea). This approach (four surveys per year in four survey sites) is in compliance
with the method for assessing the threshold value for beach litter and would provide a sufficient number of surveys
(over 40) within a 3-year period (van Loon et al., 2020).

It should be highlighted that all necessary precautions should be taken to ensure that surveys will not pose any threat
to endangered or protected species such as sea turtles, shorebirds, marine mammals, or sensitive beach
vegetation/habitats. In many cases, this could exclude protected areas from survey areas; however, this will depend on
local management arrangements.

### Survey site metadata

For each survey site, metadata on the characteristics of the site should be recorded and saved to facilitate the
analysis and interpretation of results. Using the form provided in Annex I Survey site (beach) identity form . This form
needs to be filled out once for each survey site and then updated if significant changes to the characteristics of the
site occur (e.g. creation of a new residential area nearby).

The information that should be recorded for each survey site includes the following (see Annex I Survey site (beach)
identity form for metrics and units):

* the total length of the coast/beach
* the latitude and longitude of the central point of the beach (to identify the position of the beach)
* degree of urbanisation (urban, semi-urban, remote/natural)
* features related to the back of the beach (i.e. cliffs, dunes, rocks, forest, bush, crops, fields, built-up area, road,
other)
* features related to the development behind the beach (e.g. camping, road, hotels);
* the main orientation of the coast/beach (i.e. the direction the coast is facing when looking from the coast to the sea)
* coastline curvature (i.e. linear, concave, convex or sinusoidal)
* beach substrate (i.e. percentage of sand, pebbles, rocky coast)
* objects in the sea that influence the currents (e.g. reefs)
* beach slope (i.e. level, gentle slope, moderate slope, steep slope)
* beach access (i.e. pedestrian, vehicle, only boat)
* beach usage (e.g. tourism and recreation, fishing) indicating for each usage if it is primary or secondary and whether
* estimated number of people using the beach (seasonal average)
* any other relevant information (e.g. an incidental large-scale touristic event such as a surfing competition which may

Some of this information can be obtained from maps and similar sources (e.g. Google Earth™ images), although this information 
should be checked by direct observation at the site. The collection of metadata would ideally be a task for a national or 
local coordinator of the beach litter surveys, who can access the required information and
collect the information in a uniform way for all beaches.

### Survey frequency and timing

Preferably four surveys per year should be carried out for each survey site. The proposed periods in which the surveys
are to be performed are the following:

* winter January
* spring April
* summer July
* autumn October

These periods are more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. However, regional or even local conditions might
prevent the performance of surveys in the periods proposed. Weather conditions (e.g. snow) in particular could prevent
surveys in winter or spring. In addition, a high volume of tourists and extremely hot weather might hinder surveys in
July. Surveys should not be undertaken during periods when there is a risk of affecting endangered or protected species,
such as sea turtles and birds (i.e. nesting period).

While using harmonised monitoring periods among the countries is highly recommended, it is up to the national
coordinators of beach litter surveys to choose the survey periods best suited for their regions.

### Sampling unit

According to Commission Decision (EU) 2017/848, the unit of measurement for beach macro litter is the amount of litter
per category in terms of number of items per 100 m of the coastline.

The sampling unit is a stretch of coast of 100 m in length covering the area from the water edge to the back of the
beach measured at half the actual width as a curved line on curved beaches or a straight line on straight beaches.
Examples of how to measure the length of the sampling units are provided in Figure 3.2(b). Please note that, if the
monitored stretch deviates slightly from the suggested 100 m length, the results must be normalised to 100 m when
reported.

Sampling units should represent the general characteristics of the survey site and the overall state of litter within
it. The sampling units should not be placed on the edges of a beach or on parts of the beach that have a higher
likelihood of accumulating litter. In addition, the sampling unit should not be placed in potential litter hotspots,
such as areas near the entrance of the beach, near coastal parking lots or directly in front of hotels. Based on these
considerations, a set of potential sampling units should be identified and a random selection of survey units should
then be made from this set (e.g. dividing the coast into 100 m sections and randomly choosing a number of these sections
as sampling units) (Figure 3.3). However, existing sampling units from long-running monitoring programmes (e.g. those 
used for the first MSFD monitoring cycle) should continue to be surveyed.

In heavily littered survey sites (i.e. where a 100 m stretch requires more than 1 day of work to be surveyed), a smaller 
sampling unit (at least a 50 m stretch of coast covering the area from the water to the back of the
beach), representative of the situation, can be monitored. Note that the results must be normalised to 100 m when
reported to obtain comparable results. 

Monitoring more than one sampling unit at the same survey site allows an estimation of the sample variability (e.g. the
sample mean and standard error).

### Sampling unit metadata

The same sampling units should be monitored for all surveys planned in the monitoring programme. The and sampling unit
end latitude/longitude) (see Figure 3.2(a)). If absolutely necessary (e.g. because of the construction of a tourist
facility), the sampling units can be replaced with new units within the same stretch of coast. In such cases, new
metadata must be recorded. As beach litter distribution is usually heterogenic, even on a small scale, the replacement
sampling unit must be very close to the original one. Coordinates obtained by GPS are useful for identifying the
sampling units; easily identifiable landmarks can be used, provided that their presence and position are consistently
maintained over time.

The following information can be collated once for each sampling unit (using the form provided in Annex II Sampling unit
identity form ) and, once recorded in a database, can be used for all future surveys:

* the sampling unit length, measured along the beach curve at the mid-point between the water edge and the back of the
beach (see Figures 3.2 and 3.5)
* the sampling unit width (perpendicular to the shoreline line), defined as the distance between the water edge and the
back of the beach (base of dunes, cliff, vegetation line or human artefacts) and measured at half its length beach width
should be measured at the mean water level in areas with small tidal amplitudes and at the mean high tide level for
areas with high tidal amplitude (see Figures 3.2(a) and 3.5)
* start/end GPS coordinates
* direction of the prevailing winds
* direction of the prevailing water currents
* name, distance to and position of the nearest town, and the size its residential population
* distance to and position of the nearest food/drink outlet and the months in which the food/drink outlets are present
* name, distance to and position of the nearest harbour and the type of shipping using the harbour (e.g. passenger,
merchant, fishing, military, recreational)
* name, distance to and position of the nearest river mouth
* distance to and position of the nearest wastewater or stormwater discharge point
* distance to and position of the nearest shipping lane and the type and intensity of marine traffic.
* from maps and similar sources (e.g. Google Earth™ images),

## Survey protocol

### Survey metadata

For each survey performed on a sampling unit, the following data should be recorded:

* sampling unit code/name
* survey date
* Surveyors’ names and contact details
* length of the surveyed sampling unit, which may differ slightly from the suggested 100 m, measured along the beach curve
at the midpoint between the water edge and the back of the beach (see Figures 3.2(b) and 3.5)
* date of the last known cleaning action (e.g. municipality beach cleaning, clean-up days)
* weather conditions during the dates of the surveys
* any deviation from the sampling protocol (e.g. transect length reduction or displacement of the transect, sampling
outside the expected period, subsampling) and motivation (e.g. extreme weather events, flooding, new infrastructures in
place)
* special circumstances and events that could have caused unusual litter in terms of abundance and/or type (e.g. clean-up
actions, mechanical cleaning, beach party or competition, cargo losses nearby, extreme weather conditions)
* information on any entangled fauna encountered during the survey (details of the organism, nature of entanglement, live
or dead).

### Litter sampling

To ensure that all macro litter items are recorded in the sampling unit, a systematic sampling approach should be
deployed. Some examples are shown in Figure 3.6. All items found on the surface of the sampling unit must be recorded
(litter items should not be dug up). Items entangled in seaweed or other natural materials should also be considered.

### Litter size ranges and classification

A lower limit of 2.5 cm in the longest dimension is set for macro litter items monitored during beach surveys. However,
the specific objects listed in the list below should be recorded in all cases, even if they measure less than 2.5 cm. An
upper size limit has not been established.

* J182 Metal fisheries-related weights/sinkers, and lures
* J178 Metal bottle caps, lids and pull tabs from cans 
* J195 Metal household batteries 
* J21 Plastic caps/lids drinks 
* J100 Plastic medical/pharmaceuticalscontainers/tubes/packaging 
* J22 Plastic caps/lids chemicals, detergents (non-food) 
* J23 Plastic caps/lids unidentified 
* J24 Plastic rings from bottle caps/lids 
* J91 Plastic biomass holder from sewage treatment plants and aquaculture 
* J32 Plastic toys and party poppers 
* J60 Plastic fishing light sticks / fishing glow sticks including packaging 
* J257 Foamed plastic packaging 
* J27 Tobacco products with filters (cigarette butts with filters) 
* J131 Rubber band (small, for kitchen/household/post use)
* J125 Rubber balloons

The MSFD TG ML Joint List of Litter Categories for Marine Macrolitter Monitoring (Fleet et al., 2021) should be used for
classifying the litter items sampled. Using the most detailed level of the joint list is highly recommended. The manual
for applying the Joint List classification system provides detailed information on how to classify litter items (Fleet
et al., 2021).

Litter items can be classified and recorded either on-site or in a sheltered place (e.g. a lab) after the sampling has
been completed (e.g. in the case of bad weather conditions and/or heavily littered beaches); however, the latter
approach should be avoided for weathered or fragile items, which can easily disintegrate, potentially leading to an
overestimation of these litter items.

For specific purposes, it may be worth recording additional data regarding litter items (Cau et al., 2019), for example:

* the expiry date and/or the production date reported on food packaging or other containers
* the geographical origin of the item if the label or the barcode is readable
* whether it is deposited in situ or whether it was washed out from the sea
* weight per material category (i.e. chemicals, clothes/textile, food waste (organic), glass/ceramics, artificial
* polymers/plastic, paper/cardboard, rubber, processed/worked wood)
* the size of litter items, since this can provide a link to litter quantities (the manual for the application of the
Joint List of Litter Categories for Marine Macrolitter Monitoring (Fleet et al., 2021) provides recommended approaches
to recording the size of objects).

### Litter removal

All items sampled during the survey must be removed from the sampling unit. The litter collected should be disposed of
properly. Local, regional or national regulations and arrangements for waste disposal should be followed. Larger items
that cannot be removed (safely) by the surveyors should be marked, for example, with paint spray (that meets
environmentally friendly standards) so that they are not counted again in the next surveys.

### Survey equipment and consumables

The following equipment and consumables are recommended when carrying out the surveys:

* a hand-held GPS unit (with extra batteries);
* a measuring wheel or a 100 m decametre;
* flag markers/stakes;
* a sturdy 30 cm ruler;
* a clipboard and field sheets (one per team) and/or a mobile phone or a tablet for recording litter items;
* pencils and rubbers;
* printed list of items (the Joint List codes and names are recommended);
* high-resolution cameras (e.g. digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR), mirrorless, smartphones);
* protective gloves;
* bags to collect the litter (mesh bags can be used for bigger items);
* a rigid container and sealable lid to collect sharp items such as needles;
* a first aid kit.

### Safety considerations

Safety should be the number one priority during any survey activity. Since this work is carried out in the field, there
are a few inherent hazards. Caution should be used, and the general safety guidelines presented below should be
followed.

Start the monitoring about 1 hour after high tide to prevent surveyors from being cut off by the incoming tide.

Check and avoid circumstances that may lead to unsafe situations for surveyors: heavy winds, slippery rocks and hazards
such as rain, snow or ice.

Wear appropriate clothing (sturdy shoes and gloves) when handling litter, as they may have sharp edges. If you come
across a potentially hazardous material (e.g. oil or chemical drums, gas cans, propane tanks), contact competent
authorities to report the item. Do not touch or sniff the material or attempt to move it.

Large, heavy objects should be left in place. Do not attempt to lift heavy litter items; instead, report them to the
appropriate authorities for removal.

When in doubt, do not pick it up! If the item is potentially hazardous (e.g. ammunition), report it to the appropriate
authorities.

Be aware of your surroundings and be mindful of trip and fall hazards.

Always carry a first aid kit. The kit should include an emergency water supply, sunscreen and bug spray.

Understand the symptoms of heat or cold stress and the actions to treat them.

Make sure to carry enough water.

Carry a means of communication for emergencies, for example, a mobile phone.

Let someone know where you are and when you expect to return.

### Quality assurance / quality control

Implementation of consistent QA/QC practices should be considered early and throughout the beach macro litter monitoring
process, including the monitoring strategy design, the sampling and classification, the data processing and reporting.
Although there are many facets to QA/QC, the most important elements when surveying macro litter are related to the
survey sites locations and their respective number, the timing of surveys, the positioning of the sampling unit on the
survey site, the collection and classification of litter items, the data control and reporting and the metadata
documentation.

### General quality assurance / quality control measures

Establishment of a beach macro litter monitoring organogram. It is recommended that the Member States establish an
organisational chart with clear-cut and distinct roles for each type of staff (including third parties, NGOs) involved
in the design and implementation of the beach macro litter monitoring strategy. Some proposed roles include national
coordinators, local coordinators, fieldworkers/surveyors, and data managers with one or more of the following QA/QC
related roles. These roles can include:

* establishment of a national macro litter monitoring strategy
* selection of survey sites in compliance with this guidance
* training, coordination, and supervision of field workers
* collection and recording of data and metadata related to the survey sites, the sampling unit and the survey
* establishment of contact with local municipalities and local NGOs to better plan the surveys and obtain the latest information on beach-cleaning activities
* performance of quality control for the monitoring data (checking the correctness of the data directly before and after their entry into a database and undertaking an annual quality control examination of national beach macro litter data)
* management of the national macro litter monitoring dataset, including all related data and metadata.

### Establishment of an advanced training programme. 

High-quality training is essential to ensure data quality, and it needs
to include the development of operational (field) skills. It is recommended that the surveyors are engaged on a long-
term basis to maintain experience and knowledge of how the monitoring should be performed. Member States should provide
adequate training for the fieldworkers who participate in the surveys. Staff and/or volunteer training programmes should
also incorporate information on the results and outcomes of the beach macro litter surveys so that field workers can
understand the context of the macro litter assessment programme. In addition, the training programme should include
hands-on calibration exercises to ensure, among other aspects, that macro litter items are attributed correctly to the
litter types included in the field protocols. Inter-calibration exercises with neighbouring countries and at the
regional sea level could be carried out if necessary.

### Quality assurance / quality control measures related to sampling

When performing the beach macro litter sampling, the following best practice measures are recommended to reduce biases
and/or errors.

1. Sampling design. Identifying appropriate survey sites (sampling site) types and numbers is paramount for establishing a
comprehensive macro litter monitoring programme. Survey sites should be identified by using a stratified randomised
approach. An initial pool of survey sites should be identified with locations that reflect different human-induced
pressures leading to different litter densities and compositions. From this pool of locations, the actual sites should
be selected randomly, considering the characteristics mentioned in Section 3.5.1. A sufficient number of survey sites
should be chosen considering the coastline length of a country and the diversification of pressures (in terms of
intensity or typology).

2. Sampling unit. To ensure that the sampling unit reflects the overall beach status, it should be positioned in the most
representative section of the beach. This means that the parts of the beach where litter might tend to accumulate should
be avoided and the sampling units should be located at least 50 m from points of access to the beach. In addition,
special attention should be given to surveying exactly the same sampling unit in each seasonal survey and keeping to
precisely the same 100 m stretches of the beach during each survey. If a sampling unit has to be moved for some reason
(e.g. erosion of the coastline), it must be defined as a new sampling unit.

3. Representative sampling. Beach macro litter sampling is influenced by many factors, such as extreme weather phenomena
and clean-up operations. It is recommended that the beach macro litter survey be postponed to at least 14-days after a
weather-related or clean-up-related event that may have affected the abundance of macro litter on the beach. In
addition, sampling units could be explicitly marked as national monitoring areas (e.g. by putting signs on the
coastline) to discourage people from removing litter from that site. Moreover, a national database could be set up to
register all coastal clean-up activities.

4. Replicate surveys. To increase the accuracy and precision of beach macro litter data from beach surveys, replicate
surveys in close proximity to the sampling unit can be conducted. Average values can then be used for assessments. For
research purposes, the individual replicate survey data can be stored separately.

### Quality assurance / quality control measures related to sample processing

The sample processing elements of a beach macro litter survey address the litter items removal, sorting and
classification. The following best practice measures are recommended.

1. Litter item collection. All the litter items found (without digging) on the beach within the boundaries of the sampling
unit must be collected. Litter items that easily break or get entangled and/or are weathered must be classified on-site
to avoid the introduction of errors in their numbers due to fragmentation or entanglement during transport and
processing.

2. Litter items sorting and classification. All macro litter items collected should be classified according to the
categories of the Joint List of macro litter items. The photo guide can help the surveyors identify and categorise the
litter items (12). Pieces of litter that are recognisable (e.g. a piece of a drinking bottle) should be registered as
such (see also Fleet et al., 2021). Unusual or unknown litter items or recognisable litter items, that are not
attributable to litter types from the field protocol, should be recorded along with a description and a photograph. In
this way, emerging litter types can be identified and considered for inclusion updates/revisions of the protocol. It is
recommended that the most experienced members of the surveying team supervise the final classification of the litter
items.

### Quality assurance / quality control measures related to data processing and reporting

All data and metadata should be reported using a ‘standardised’ data
reporting sheet. The local coordinator should undertake the data collation and data quality assurance for each survey.
Once submitted to the national database, the data should undergo additional control by the national data manager. The
national coordinator will undertake responsibility for the review and final approval of uploaded data and will clarify
any issues with local coordinators. Annual checklist documentation will provide an incentive for national coordinators,
at the end of the monitoring year, to check that all surveys have been carried out and that all relevant information has
been collected and entered into the appropriate beach litter database. This would ensure a high level of consistency
within each region and create a hierarchy of quality assurance on data acquisition. The use of such a system will also
support a comprehensive analysis of the data providing the opportunity to undertake statistically robust comparisons
over time and between survey locations (Cheshire et al., 2009). Relevant databases that serve the needs of the Member
States are made available by EMODnet (https://www.emodnet-chemistry.eu/marinelitter) for European Regional Seas, and by
the OSPAR Commission for the north-east Atlantic Ocean (http://beachlitter.ospar.org).

### Costs and efforts needed for beach monitoring

Compared with the methods described in this guidance for other compartments, beach litter monitoring is far less
burdensome in terms of efforts and costs. In most cases, the survey sites can be easily reached by car and on foot. The
operators need a low/medium level of expertise to collect and categorise the items, as long as expert supervisors train
the participants and perform accurate quality control during and after the collection, especially regarding the marine
litter item subcategories. The equipment required to perform the beach surveys is mainly related to the safety of the
operators, while, for the actual collection and classification of the items, the expenses are low (see Section 3.4.2.5).
The time required for collecting the items may vary greatly depending on the state of the beach and, thus, the quantity
of litter accumulated. In general terms, 1-day may be sufficient to monitor one survey site (100 m length), including
the collection, characterisation and disposal of the items. The relatively simple and easy-to-apply protocol for
coastlines allows several Member States to involve NGOs and citizen science projects, which may drastically increase the
cost-effectiveness of beach monitoring programmes under the MSFD. Beach litter data can be analysed with basic
statistical methods and software, at least for a general overview and reporting purposes.

### Other beach macro litter monitoring methodologies an overview

In addition to the beach macro litter monitoring method described in this guidance, which provides data for the MSFD
reporting requirements, several other methods are used to perform beach macro litter surveys, with different aims. The
data from these surveys could potentially be compared with the MSFD monitoring data by using the Joint List of Litter
Categories for Marine Macrolitter Monitoring. While it is not possible to specify a best method in general, it should be
kept in mind that it is important to adopt the most appropriate monitoring methodology taking into account the aims of
the study, the characteristics of the sites monitored,
the staff involved and other specific aspects of the survey. It is also important to acknowledge that each methodology
has its pros and cons and strengths and limitations that need to be considered when analysing and interpreting the data
(Velander and Mocogni, 1999).

Beach macro litter studies are commonly categorised into two main types: accumulation and standing stock studies (Ryan
et al., 2009). Accumulation studies require the initial removal of all litter from the site, followed by regular surveys
to record and remove all litter. The data collected over time may provide an estimate of 8). To have a realistic
estimate of loading rates (fluxes), a high frequency of sampling is needed, which may pose substantial challenges in
terms of high time costs (Smith and Markic, 2013). Conversely, carrying out surveys four times a year, as suggested in
this guidance, allows the assessment of long-term balance between input and output (standing stock). In contrast,
surveys that are run more frequently provide information on what is arriving over a shorter time frame (GESAMP, 2019).

### Rapid surveys

Rapid surveys for beach litter (i.e. surveys that can be completed in a short time and are not based on a detailed
assessment of litter types) may be used to provide an i snapshot abundance of marine litter. They can be useful in the
case of a major natural disaster (e.g. a tsunami or typhoon); to collect a qualitative or semi-quantitative estimate of
litter abundance and composition that is sufficient to direct further recovery operations or monitoring design; to
provide a baseline to inform the development of a routine monitoring programme; and to identify accumulation hot spots
for possible intervention. This kind of survey is not intended for application where detailed information about litter
amounts, composition and fluxes is required.

For instance, in the frameworks of the Interreg Mediterranean Actions for Marine Protected Areas project (AMARE)
(https://amare.interreg-med.eu) and the Interreg Mediterranean Plastic Busters Marine Protected Areas
(https://plasticbustersmpas.interreg-med.eu) project, rapid surveys for beach litter were performed with small boats
(5-6 m) operating at low speed (1-12 knots) from 20 m to 100 m from the shore along the coast of Corsica (France). The
presence of litter was recorded for low accumulation zones (2-10 litter items per site, which were usually a 5-30 m
apart) and high accumulation zones (> 10 litter items per site). The position of accumulation areas was recorded using
GPS. A detailed assessment of litter types was not performed.

The development of image capture using aerial photography has proved to be useful for rapid assessments of litter,
allowing large-scale coverage (GESAMP, 2019). These methods and their limitations are described in the subsequent
sections.

### Imaging techniques

Imaging techniques are particularly useful for detecting litter in dense vegetation (e.g. reed beds), and for non-
destructive observations in sensitive habitats (e.g. salt marshes) and remote or inaccessible coastlines. Indeed,
distant and rugged coastline segments are usually challenging to monitor conventionally. A variety of remote, aerial
monitoring methods have been implemented, using fixed-wing aircraft (Kataoka et al., 2018), bush planes (Moy et al.,
2018), balloons (Nakashima et al., 2011), aerial vehicles (Papakonstantinou et al., 2016; Deidun et al., 2018; Martin et
al., 2018) and webcams (Kako et al., 2018; Kataoka et al., 2018).

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) / unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) (e.g. drones) may be good technological options for
beach macro litter monitoring (e.g. Martin et al., 2018; Papakonstantinou et al., 2021). Their use has the advantages of
high image acquisition frequency, high spatial resolution, the ability to fly at low altitudes below clouds, and high
mobility (Bao et al., 2018). UAVs/UASs can be used to acquire georeferenced red, green and blue (RGB) images along the
coastline cost-effectively and rapidly (Deidun et al., 2018). A post-processing system based on visual interpretation of
the images allows the localisation and identification of the marine litter within the scanned area and the estimation of
its spatial and temporal distribution (Merlino et al., 2020). Deep learning algorithms can automatically identify and
quantify marine litter (Fallati et al., 2019). However, it has been shown that monitoring with UAVs/UASs may lead to an
underestimation of beach litter compared with human inspection since, for instance, hidden and transparent items cannot
be detected (Merlino et al., 2020). Another limitation of using UAVs/UASs is adverse weather conditions because surveys
cannot be carried out on windy or rainy days.

Another method that could be used for inaccessible beaches is based on the acquisition of high-resolution images through
vessel-based photography surveys (Papachristopoulou et al., 2020) or by applying image processing techniques to archived
shoreline aerial photographs (Kataoka et al., 2018). Vessel-based
photography provides a good trade-off between high-quality photographic documentation, spatial coverage, processing
time, and operational cost. At the same time, unlike other remote methods, it could easily be performed by non-experts
(Papachristopoulou et al., 2020). However, it is worth noting that the quantification of beach litter abundance through
remote photography may result in an underestimation of litter densities when the quality and resolution of the images
are poor, for instance, as a consequence of bad illumination due to bad weather or it being impossible to navigate close
to the coast.

### Participatory science and community-based initiatives

Even though there is no internationally accepted definition of citizen science, the term mainly refers to the
involvement of non-professional volunteers, typically in data collection, but also in other phases of the scientific
process, such as data interpretation, problem definition or the dissemination of results (Bonney et al., 2009; Haklay,
2015).

Participatory science is a more inclusive term that refers to research conducted in partnership between trained experts
and members of a community or CSOs [civil society organis , including non- governmental organisations (NGOs) (Gall et
al., 2009, p. 12). Throughout the years, NGOs have significantly contributed to providing data and information on the
temporal and spatial distribution of marine litter found stranded on beaches, and participatory science campaigns have
proved to be an essential tool to fill in the marine litter knowledge gaps (Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel, 2015). In many cases,
environmental NGOs can produce fit-for-purpose and accurate beach litter monitoring data for institutional purposes
(Vlachogianni et al., 2020).

### Clean-up and removal

Community-based beach litter initiatives mainly focus on clean-up and removal actions (e.g. Ocean Conservancy
International Coastal Cleanup, NOAA Marine Debris Program, Clean Up the Med campaign, SeaCleaner) rather than
research/monitoring actions. These actions may generate estimates of litter amounts at a particular site. Community-
based projects that focus on research and monitoring (citizen science) can produce good-quality data on litter (e.g. van
Der Velde et al., 2017; Vincent et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020; Haarr et al., 2020; Kideys and Aydin, 2020;
Vlachogianni and Scoullos, 2023), provided that volunteers are trained, and professionals/scientists supervise and guide
them. A rigorous citizen science programme requires intensive coordination and communication with the volunteer
participants. The resulting data must be controlled, reviewed and validated by experts to remove mistakes and spot
unlikely results that are from can generate added value in addition to producing new data; for example, it can raise
awareness, strengthen custodianship for the local environment and increase pressure on policymakers to act (Merlino et
al., 2015; GESAMP, 2019).

### Hotspot surveys

While the MSFD coastline litter surveys are based on the repeated monitoring of a fixed set of beaches, litter
quantification on other beaches may provide important complementary information and help to identify litter hotspots
that might require special attention, potentially reducing litter input to the marine environment, for example, through
specific local measures. Such surveys would ideally use the same protocols as the MSFD surveys and thus enable a
comparison of data.

### Rare events monitoring and early warning

Opportunistic beach litter surveys involving citizens can provide a cost-effective approach to documenting relatively
rare events such as animal in litter or to following the spread of massive quantities of litter items along the
coastline due to unexpected events, such as a cargo loss or an accident along the coastline. This type of survey is
based on massive amounts of ngagement, resulting in the broader distribution of the observations in space and time and
an early warning system. Dedicated websites and/or apps can facilitate the collection of this data (e.g.
https://seawatcher.info-rac.org).

### The EEA Marine Litter Watch

The EEA has developed the Marine Litter Watch to support to European policy implementation. MLW offers tools an app (13)
and a public database (14) - to collect and share data on marine litter on beaches. A web portal (15) is also available
for the communities to manage their events and data. Communities organise events on beaches and make surveys with the
Marine Litter Watch app to report on litter items found.

### Resources

When recording and analysing litter on the coastline, Member States and other communities can benefit from the set of
tools and resources developed in the last decade to collect, store, visualise and analyse data.

EMODnet. EMODnet is a European initiative funded by the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. The
initiative is divided into seven thematic areas, each focused on a specific topic. EMODnet Chemistry
(https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/chemistry) started in 2009, intending to support the MSFD implementation with a data
management plan (Molina-Jack et al., 2019). Marine litter was included among the target parameters in 2017. In recent
years, a joint task has been performed to develop a standard data structure for marine litter at the European level. It
was modelled to host MSFD monitoring data, following the OSPAR beach litter database (OSPAR-MCS) approach and taking
into account the MSFD TG ML and UNEP / Mediterranean Action Plan requirements (Molina-Jack et al., 2019). The
collaborative action between the JRC, the TG ML, and EMODnet Chemistry for gathering official MSFD monitoring data for
calculating European baselines and thresholds gave the database an initial boost, including a large number of datasets
in 2018 (Partescano et al. 2021).

LitteR. LitteR (Schulz et al., 2019) is an open-source statistic tool for analysing litter data developed as an R
package (R Core Team, 2021), to support OSPAR and EU scientists and policymakers. This package offers a simple user
interface for analysing litter data in a consistent and reproducible way. It contains routines for data quality control,
outlier analysis, descriptive statistics, trend analysis and regional aggregation of states and trends. The tool
produces a detailed analysis report in HTML format, from which tables and figures can be copied
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/litteR/). Schulz et al. (2017, 2019) provide more background information on the
statistical data analysis of beach litter.
