# What's in a name? Unpacking “participatory” environmental monitoring

**INTRODUCTION**
Participatory environmental monitoring (PEM) refers to a
plethora of approaches involving local people in the structured
gathering of information about the environment where they live
(Abbot and Guijt 1998). Recent years have seen a growing
emphasis on such approaches that claim to be cost-effective in
yielding valid environmental monitoring data while simultaneously
empowering local people through participation (Danielsen et al.
2013a). Although a quick check of this literature suggests that
there is variation in how PEM schemes take the concept of
“participation” into practice, to date there has been little effort to
systematically analyze this aspect across the growing number of
PEM schemes (but see Danielsen et al. 2009). In this paper we
aim to fill this gap through a systematic literature review assessing
the different ways in which local people participate in PEM
schemes.

PEM is a form of environmental monitoring. Generally speaking,
environmental monitoring refers to the actions oriented to detect
changes in natural processes or human activities affecting
biophysical systems. Results from environmental monitoring are
typically used to support decision making and planning in relation
to natural resources management (Abbot and Guijt 1998).
Environmental monitoring has traditionally been carried out by
professional scientists generally incurring large financial costs
(Danielsen et al. 2009). The growing emphasis on assessing larger
scale environmental trends, especially after the 1992 Rio
Conference, resulted in increased efforts to monitor the
environment. In this context, researchers argued that
participatory approaches would be a cost-effective solution to
environmental monitoring with significant social cobenefits in the
form of local empowerment (Danielsen et al. 2007, 2013a,
Larrazábal et al. 2012).

For the purpose of this review, we consider as PEM the variety
of approaches that involve any level of local and/or
nonprofessional participation in monitoring. In the literature,
such approaches are also referred to as “community-based” (e.g.,
Topp-Jørgensen et al. 2005, Bellfield et al. 2015, Johnson et al.
2015), “locally based” (e.g., Danielsen et al. 2005, 2010, Nielsen
and Lund 2012), or “hunter/fisher self-reports” (e.g., Noss et al.
2005, Uychiaoco et al. 2005, Rist et al. 2010). To be as inclusive
as possible, we adopt the definition of PEM senso lato, and include
published efforts that have been referred to as participatory,
community-based, locally based, or community-led monitoring
or patrolling and that involve local, rural, and/or indigenous
peoples or communities.

The concept of participation has a long history in research and
development. To unravel its meaning in the context of PEM, we
distinguish between spaces of participation created for people and
those created by people (Cornwall 2008). The latter refers to selforganized networks and movements that are created and framed
by those who participate in them. The protests against oil-carrying
pipelines in North America, where citizens come together and, in
many cases, organize their own information collection, analysis,
and communication to further their protest (see e.g., [https://www.](https://www.oilandwaterdontmix.org/)
[oilandwaterdontmix.org/), are examples of such spaces. Although](https://www.oilandwaterdontmix.org/)
in such self-organized movements, local people have high degrees
of ownership and control over the purpose and process of
participation, PEM schemes are almost invariably created by
someone else than the local people who are, in turn, invited to
participate in a space created for them. For example, local
community involvement in carbon monitoring for REDD+
(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
in Developing Countries) is a created space for local people’s
[participation (http://redd.unfccc.int/).](http://redd.unfccc.int/)

By definition, created spaces of participation come with
predefined agendas and, therefore, limits to participation.
Different approaches have been suggested to further understand
the nature of participation in such spaces. White (1996)
distinguished four types of participation drawing on the interests
and functions that the different actors have. Using this analysis
she distinguished between nominal, instrumental, representative,
and transformative participation. For example, in instrumental
participation, involving local people in data collection may mean
cost-efficiency for the actors who created the scheme, while the
local people may perceive it as a cost in terms of time spent doing
the monitoring. Thus, an examination of different actors’
perceptions of what participation implies, reveals the underlying
motives for participatory efforts as well as of the implications for
different actors of how the efforts unfold in practice.

Pretty (1995) provides a hierarchical typology of participation
that allows us to differentiate among six different levels of
participation depending on the level of empowerment and
autonomy of those who are invited to participate, i.e., local people.
Among the lowest levels of participation in this typology we find
manipulative participation, where top-down processes and
decisions are legitimized by being called participatory and, in fact,
no or little participation exists. Passive and consultative
participation occurs when those who are invited simply receive
and provide information, respectively. Functional participation
implies that people are invited to participate because organizers
believe it may lower the costs of achieving objectives. At a higher
level we find interactive participation, in which participants and
organizers of the participatory space are on more equal footing
in deciding the purposes and process of participation. Finally,
self-mobilization refers to processes where participation is no
longer by invitation, but rather a self-created space. The term selfmobilization parallels the notion of participatory spaces created
by people (Cornwall 2008).

It is worth acknowledging, however, that while we could
reasonably characterize the participatory element in PEM
processes by analyzing how these processes facilitate local
empowerment, participatory processes are rarely predictable and
might have unintended outcomes. For example, Tanzanian
villagers participating in a PEM scheme with the predefined
purpose of providing information about forest quality and
disturbances were found to carefully manage the information
created by the monitoring to safeguard their autonomy (Nielsen
and Lund 2012, Funder et al. 2013). Thus, a monitoring effort
that had clear elements of control and oversight by higher-level
authorities was reshaped by the invited, local-level actors.

Our starting point for developing a framework with which to
characterize participation is the work of Danielsen et al. (2009).
These authors identify categories of monitoring schemes based
on the level of involvement in data gathering and use by local
stakeholders and scientists. Specifically, they differentiate among
five types of participatory monitoring setups: (1) externally driven
and professionally executed; (2) externally driven with local data
collectors; (3) collaborative monitoring with external data
interpretation; (4) collaborative monitoring with local data
interpretation and; (5) autonomous local monitoring. Further,
we are inspired by Shirk et al. (2012) who emphasized the
importance of the degree and quality of public participation in
the input stages of the research process. Shirk et al. (2012) assessed
the degree of participation through a quantifiable measure of
duration of involvement, research effort, numbers and/or
diversity of stakeholders, and the quality of participation by
examining the extent to which a project’s goals and activities align
with local participants’ needs and interests. We define the input
stages of the projects as the ideation (whose initiative the
monitoring is) and design (who takes the decisions at the planning
stages). Hence, drawing on insights of Danielsen et al. (2009) and
Shirk et al. (2012) our framework takes into account the five
commonly defined project stages, which are ideation, design, data
collection, evaluation, and use of the data. To unpack the
practices involved in PEM we reviewed 119 articles reporting
PEM case studies, structured on the following two questions: Who
is involved in PEM efforts and how? And whose interests are
pursued in participation?

## METHODS

We used two standard web-based search engines, the Web of
Science and Scopus, to identify published case studies reporting
PEM projects. Keywords used in the search included related terms
encompassing three main concepts: (i) “participatory” or
“community-based” or “locally-based” or “community-led”; (ii)
“monitoring” or “patrolling”; and (iii) “local communities” or
“rural communities” or “local people” or “indigenous.” The
search included documents published in English and up to
December 2015 (included). The search was limited to case studies,
thus excluding reviews and theoretical papers.

The search resulted in 267 documents. An initial screening was
done based on the title, abstract, and general content of these
documents to select those providing information about PEM
projects. A total of 119 documents (44.5% of those initially
identified) referred to one or more projects involving local people
in environmental monitoring. These works were selected for an
in-depth examination. When a document reported data from
more than one project, we classified each project as a different
case study, so our final sample consisted of 146 case studies
described in 119 documents.

To unpack participation, we gathered the following information
from each case study: (1) different actors’ participation in each
PEM stage; (2) characteristics of those involved in data collection
(number of individuals, livelihood), including whether they were
remunerated or not; (3) local participants’ motivations to
participate and; (4) actors’ perceived costs and benefits of the
PEM project. To allow for quantitative analysis, all the
information collected was coded (Table 1) and entered in a
Microsoft Office Access 2007 database specifically designed for
this work.

We noted the specific location where data were collected and the
total duration of the monitoring project (in months). We recorded
whether the main livelihood of the local population was based on
the direct use of natural resources, i.e., gathering, agriculture,


### Variable Definition Format

fishing, and pastoralism, or not. Finally, we also noted whether
monitors were paid for the monitoring activity or not (0 = no,
never; 1 = sometimes; 2 = yes; 3 = not specified). Monitors that
were described as volunteers were considered as not paid or to
have received a small contribution.

The project stages were classified as ideation, design, data
collection, i.e., monitoring, evaluation, and use of data. The
participants were classified into seven categories, some of them
combining two or more actors: (1) professionals/researchers,
including rangers and foresters; (2) local communities, including
lay citizens and community networks; (3) governmental and
nongovernmental organizations (hereafter “external organizations”);
(4) professionals/researchers and local communities; (5) local
communities and external organizations; 6) professionals/
researchers and external organizations; and (7) all actors involved.
Multiple categories could be checked per case study. Information
regarding actors’ participation in the different stages was
transcribed verbatim from the articles; final classifications were
revised by the first author. We also noted down the number of
monitors.

We extracted statements on the local people’s motivations to
participate and later classified them into 17 codes, e.g., landscape
management or empowerment. Multiple motivations could be
reported per case study. Finally, we recorded the perceived costs
and benefits reportedly expressed by each of the actors regarding
the implementation of the PEM projects, which were later
categorized according to the types of participation of White
(1996), i.e., nominal, instrumental, representative, and
transformative. Perceptions that could not be categorized as such
were categorized as “other.”

We used descriptive and bivariate statistics to analyze data. To
visualize the geographical clustering of the case studies, we
performed a kernel density estimation analysis (see Reyes-García
et al. 2015) using QGIS 2.6 Brighton. We then explored patterns
of frequency of participants’ involvement in the various PEM
stages. We analyzed the percentage of case studies reporting
number of monitors and populations involved. We also calculated
the percentage of cases mentioning motivations of local
participants and selected cases that represented the most common
motivations to use as examples. We finally calculated the


distribution of perceptions that belonged to each of the types of
participation of White (1996), and commented on few remarkable cases.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### Description of PEM projects
From the initial pool of 276 documents, 119 (44.5%) reported
actual case studies of PEM projects. Some documents reported
more than one case study, so our total sample consisted of 146
projects. Of the remaining documents, some were theoretical
discussions and some used secondary data, such as a review of
15 locally based monitoring projects (Danielsen et al. 2005), a
review of the role of community carbon monitoring for REDD+
in developing countries (Larrazábal et al. 2012), or a theoretical
discussion on the potential for integrating community-based
monitoring into REDD+ (Torres 2014).

The period 2010 to 2015 (representing 5 of the 25 years analyzed)
featured 50% of all the articles on the topic. Of the 146 PEM
projects examined 35% were conducted in Asia, especially
Southeast Asia, 24% in Africa, 14% in South America, 13% in
North America, and 12% in Oceania. Very little research (1%) on
PEM involving lay people in Europe has been published (Fig. 1).
This geographical bias could be explained by our choice of key
words, e.g., local communities or indigenous, because most
European initiatives involving lay people in the collection of data
and information about their environments are generally done
through citizen science projects. Citizen science refers to projects
in which citizens are expected to gather observation data, e.g.,
counting birds or egg hatching events, a methodology that has
gained momentum in recent years partly because of the possibility
of collecting such data through a connected interface (Dickinson
et al. 2010). Although we did not include this key word in our
search, we did find four citizen science projects that could have
potentially been part of our review (Leach and Fairhead 2002,
Elbroch et al. 2011, Thornton and Leahy 2012, Stevens et al.
2014). However, we argue that given the methodological
differences, the bias in PEM projects found in our search might
reflect, not only the choice of words, but also fundamental
differences in how participation in environmental monitoring is
evolving with varying access to technology.

For many of the projects examined, we were unable to find
information on all of our selected review variables. For example,
only 90 of the 146 PEM projects examined mentioned the project’s
starting year, and the total duration of the projects was only
mentioned in 57 cases (39% of the total). Interestingly, more than
half of the projects for which we have information about duration
(n = 35) reported less than 12 months of fieldwork, a third of
those extended over two to six years, and were used to sample
vegetation and/or animals. Without being able to draw a firm
conclusion (given the paucity of data), this short duration
suggests a tendency for PEM projects being seen as tools for rapid
data collection, inhibiting the potential for empowerment of local
communities.

The majority of the local communities involved were rural (57%),
very few were urban (4%), and 39% of the projects did not specify
who was involved in data collection. A large number of the cases
examined (40%) did not mention whether monitors were paid to
conduct the environmental monitoring. Of the 60% that
mentioned payments (n = 87), 31% reported that monitors were
never paid, 11% that they were paid sometimes, and 17% that they
were regularly paid for their work. Nevertheless, monitors might
have received other kinds of benefits, such as access to decision
makers (e.g., Vandergeest 2007).

### Participation in environmental monitoring

The analysis of participants’ involvement in the five stages of the
PEM projects (ideation, design, monitoring, evaluation, and use
of data) helps nuance the categories proposed by Danielsen et al.
(2009), and consider whether PEM projects are “invited spaces
for participation” or “spaces that people create themselves”
(Cornwall 2008:275).

Within the case studies analyzed, there was some diversity in
whether professionals/researchers, local communities, external
organizations, and mixed teams participated in one or more stages
of the project’s life-span. Overall, professionals/researchers
dominated the ideation, design, evaluation, and use of the data

stages, while local communities, alone or in collaboration with
professionals/researchers, were mainly involved in collecting data
(Fig. 2). External organizations, i.e., governmental and
nongovernmental organizations other than scientists and
professionals, participated less than the other two groups in all
the stages. However, we believe that these organizations have a
very important role in the actual execution of the projects, as,
given their long-term presence in the field, they usually act as
bridges between researchers and local communities.

Most case studies (n = 133, 91%) reported who was involved in
the data collection, but 32% of the studies did not report who
participated in the other stages. This reduces transparency and
hampers the assessment of empowerment and autonomy to those
who participate.

Our results show that in most case studies, the PEM project idea
did not originate from the local participants (only in 7 cases, 8%
of the case studies that provided information on this topic). PEM
efforts that involve scientific staff are thus almost invariably
invited spaces of participation, where the monitoring effort is
externally established and driven. According to Cornwall (2008),
lack of participation in the ideation phase would imply that the
potential to empower local communities is cut short.
Nevertheless, it is possible that other PEM projects have
originated from local participants, but that are not published.

Although the analysis shows that PEM projects are mainly
designed by professionals/scientists (70 of the cases, 63%), there
are 25 case studies (23%) in which professionals/researchers have
codesigned, or at least considered the opinion of local participants
in the design (e.g., Uychiaoco et al. 2005, Mutimukuru et al. 2006,
Stacey et al. 2013). The earliest of these codesigned case studies
is from 2005, which may indicate a growing emphasis on
participation. Shirk et al. (2012) proposed a framework for
practitioners to design participatory research that enhances its
outcomes for scientific research, individual participants, and
social-ecological systems.

As observed in Figure 2, local communities participate mainly in
the data collection, while they are less involved in ideation, design,
evaluation, and use of data. These results support the hypothesis
that most PEM projects have a top-down nature. Professionals/
researchers often train local communities on how to collect data
and then data are collected either collaboratively (58 cases, 44%)
or by local communities exclusively (52 cases, 39%).

Over a third of the projects (39%) involved less than 20 monitors,
21% involved between 20 and 350 monitors, and 39% did not
mention the number of monitors involved in data collection. The
general low number of monitors reflects that PEM projects are
usually selective and targeted, mostly involving few people only.
It is worth mentioning that the papers analyzed rarely mentioned
how the monitors conducting the PEM were selected, so it is
difficult to assess who is involved and, most importantly, who is
left out (Cornwall 2008).

Similarly, the low level of local participation beyond data
collection is also a consequence of the way PEM projects are
framed. The procedures for data management and analysis are
often developed by professionals or researchers (80% of the cases)
who may not take into consideration whether those procedures
suit the capacities and needs of local communities or not. Local
people only participated in the evaluation of the data in 11% of
the cases analyzed. For example, Ens (2012) reported a case study
in which aboriginal peoples of Australia were trained to monitor
environmental services using CyberTracker Technology. The
author also indicates that local monitors were not capable of
analyzing and interpreting the data in a meaningful way and
needed external technical assistance for these tasks. A completely
different outcome was achieved by Townsend et al. (2005), who
used simpler monitoring methods, i.e., perceived abundance and
direct and indirect counts of turtle populations, and taught the
indigenous monitors to enter the data in the computer, analyze
it, and make management decisions on the basis of their results.
The acquaintance of these skills strengthened indigenous people’s
successful petition to the government for the rights to manage
their territorial lands. These examples illustrate how the framing
of the different stages of PEM efforts matter; in other words, local
people’s ability to participate in the different stages follows from
the way in which the monitoring system is designed, including
purpose and procedures for monitoring, analysis, and use.

According to our review, data collected through PEM are often
used by professionals/researchers (55 cases, 56%), and only
occasionally by local communities (20 cases, 20%), with some
instances in which data benefit both actors (16 cases, 16%). That
local communities rarely use the data might reflect a low degree
of involvement in the overall process and, by extension, might
relate to low empowerment potential. However, our assessment
of the local involvement in the use of data should be taken with
caution because there is a general lack of specificity in the
reporting of the actual use of the data by local communities (only
specifically mentioned in 21% of the cases). Several of the case
studies featured statements about local communities’ potential
use of the data for their own benefit, for example for natural
resource management and decision making (e.g., Grundy et al.
2004, Uychiaoco et al. 2005, Mutimukuru et al. 2006, Maheshwari
et al. 2014, Boissière et al. 2014), for improving environmental
regulations/laws (e.g., Şekercioĝlu 2012, Spiegel et al. 2012), or
for establishing payments for ecosystem services (Ens 2012).
However, we lack empirical data analyzing the possibility that
some data are used by the communities in the long term or at least
after the research is concluded.

It is worth mentioning that, given the fact that our literature review
is based on peer-reviewed literature, the results presented might
be biased toward monitoring projects led by scientists. It is
possible that academic and nonacademic organizations are
involved in participatory monitoring projects in which local
participation is considered at all levels, but that those experiences
are not reflected in the academic literature. Keeping this caveat
in mind, however, the observed uneven distribution of actor’s
participation in the different stages of PEM projects raises the
question of whether PEM is actually about using local people as
cheap labor to collect data. Although there is no simple answer
to that question, two distinct approaches to PEM emerge from
the literature. Some PEM projects are actually designed with
research goals to test the PEM approach under particular
conditions, and the role of local monitors is basically reduced to
collect data at low costs (Danielsen et al. 2010a). Thus,
participation in these projects is merely functional (Pretty 1995)
and utilitarian. Conversely, other projects clearly aim to benefit
the local monitors/community in one way or another, i.e., to
improve management, provide socio-political benefits (e.g.,
Townsend et al. 2005). Taking into account that the main
involvement of local participants is in the data collection and their
input at the ideation and design of the projects is rather limited,
it could be argued that, despite researchers’ potential good
intentions, PEM is currently a functional tool to gather
information in a cost-effective way.

### Interests in PEM

We also attempted to examine the nature of participation in PEM
projects through understanding the motivations of local people
to participate as well as their project perception. If people’s
motivations reflect ownership and empowerment, we would
assume that projects allow local participation to a higher degree
than if they reflect personal gains through remuneration.

### Motivation to participate

In 30% of the papers reviewed we found explicit statements
concerning the motivation of local participants to partake in the
PEM project. From this reduced sample, we noted various aspects
that motivate local people to engage in PEM (Fig. 3), which
practitioners could take into account when designing PEM to
ensure long-term partnership with local communities. In 29% of
the cases in which local participants’ motivations to participate
were stated, people argued that they participated in monitoring
their natural resources and landscape because the information
gathered was useful to management or because gathering
information was a prerequisite to obtain or retain rights to
manage land and/or resources (e.g., Funder et al. 2013). The sociopolitical benefits associated with PEM, i.e., decision-making
allowances, empowerment, social status increase, and improving
relations with other stakeholders, were also a strong motivation
to participate (18%). For example, in a case study among ethnic
groups in the Solomon Islands, Aswani and Weiant (2004)
reported that women were motivated to participate because the
creation of their own long-term monitoring project empowered
them to build their own enterprise and to generate cash income
in a context in which women are usually undervalued.

The motivation for the creation and dissemination of knowledge
was equally relevant (18%). For example, Holck (2008) described
that local people were motivated to monitor their forests because
they felt that their knowledge was positively recognized and
valuable to the project staff and foreigners, creating a sense of
pride among community members. Some local participants also
seemed to be driven by economic incentives (14%), a motivation
which was also present in the two examples cited before. Other
reasons to participate were conservation of natural resources
(11%) and natural resources regulation and control (9%).

An important result, however, is that motivations of local actors
are rarely recorded, which raises the issue of whether they are
taken into account or not. And although some studies do report
local motivations, even in these cases it is rarely done at a level of
detail that allows us to exactly understand how the monitoring
activities benefit people. Many studies mention cursorily that a
motivation for monitoring is that local people gain useful
information to manage their natural resources, about
management rights, and/or about socio-political benefits. In

reality, these may be difficult to separate because information and
connections to powerful external actors, i.e., government
agencies, project implementers, and scientists, may be useful for
local management and have long-lasting empowerment
potentials, but they could also reflect a dependency on external
inputs, implying that local people are back at square one when
projects end. This interpretation is further strengthened by the
fact that payment is also often mentioned as a major motivation
to participate.

Taking into account that most of the reviewed PEM projects are
designed with little or no local participation and therefore address
problems that scientists or other external actors, e.g., governments
or NGOs, believe important but are not necessarily perceived as
such by local people, the continuation of an autonomous
monitoring after the project funds end might be at risk. A
paradigmatic example of this could be carbon monitoring for
REDD+, which will most probably not be voluntarily continued
by local communities after funding ends as long as the REDD+
finance mechanism is not in operation because people find no
benefit in measuring carbon-stocks as such. The analysis of other
participatory-conservation initiatives also suggests that paymentbased initiatives tend to receive higher local participation with the
pitfall that they rely on external finance mechanism putting their
longer term sustainability under question (Méndez-López et al.
2014). More longitudinal studies of PEM efforts would be useful
to enable analysis of their potential long-term empowerment
effects.

_Actors’ perception of participatory projects_
In our review we documented 268 statements that represented
views or opinions regarding participation in environmental
monitoring. Of those recorded, most belonged to professionals/
researchers (64%), followed by the perceptions expressed by local
communities and transcribed by the texts’ authors (25%), and
then by external organizations (11%).

When examining researchers’ perceptions drawing on White’s
(1996) classification (Fig. 4), we found that none of the case
studies seemed to belong to the nominal type of participation, i.
e., that the interest of the implementation agency is to display that
they are doing something. However, 41% (n = 70) of the
perceptions reflected an instrumental type of participation, i.e.,
their interests focused on efficiency, limiting funders’ input,
drawing on community contributions, and making projects more
cost-effective. For example, researchers considered that the
inclusion of indigenous knowledge was useful and could enrich
the monitoring (e.g., Townsend et al. 2005, Berkes et al. 2007) and
perceived PEM projects as a cost-effective solution for monitoring
(e.g., Dangles et al. 2010, Danielsen et al. 2010b, Rist et al. 2010,
De Angelo et al. 2011). Some researchers also mentioned some
limitations, such as the fact that PEM projects can be impractical
for tasks that require specialization, or that they can be too time
consuming (e.g., Kofinas et al. 2003, Townsend et al. 2005,
Rennaud et al. 2012). According to most researchers, local people
have the capacity to collect data (e.g., Gearheard et al. 2011, Grech
et al. 2014, Venter et al. 2015), and accuracy and precision can be
improved with training (Holck 2008, Danielsen et al. 2014). A few
researchers raised concerns over the lack of local capacity to
interpret and analyze data collected (e.g., Ens 2012,
Hjalmarsdottir 2012), which hinders the possibility for
empowerment and independence of local communities.

Twenty-four percent (n = 41) of researchers’ perceptions denoted
a representative type of participation, i.e., that they are interested
in giving people a voice in determining their own development.
For example, researchers argued that PEM can be seen as a means
to achieve more qualified resource management (e.g., Uychiaoco
et al. 2005, Chidammodzi and Muhandiki 2015) and conservation
(e.g., Setty et al. 2008, Shen and Tan 2012). Almost 10% (n = 16)
of researchers’ perceptions indicated a transformative type of
participation, i.e., that they were interested in truly empowering
people to work independently (e.g., Danielsen et al. 2010b,
Constantino et al. 2012, Peris et al. 2012). However, to achieve
self-reliance and make their own decisions, people must be trained
in data analysis and interpretation, as well as given authority over
the purposes and format of the monitoring. Other opinions about
the challenges and benefits of PEM projects of researchers (26%)
were not classified according to White’s (1996) types of
participation. For example, the empowering ability of the PEM
project was seen as hampered in circumstances when communities
had a historical dependence on a paternalistic and central
government and failed to assume responsibility to monitor and
manage natural resources (Brooks and Tshering 2010) or when
the technology used for monitoring surpassed local participants’
capacities (Spiegel et al. 2012).

Overall, in most of the case studies for which we have information
on these aspects, researchers reveal a functional or instrumental
view of the role of local participation in environmental
monitoring. In other words, the prevailing view of researchers
seems to be that local involvement is relevant to ensure better

monitoring data, as an input to local management or that it is a
cost-effective approach to monitoring. Thus, it seems that for
many researchers, the main goal of engaging in a PEM is to get
information for predefined purposes, paying less attention to the
empowerment potential. This overall impression of the interests
of researchers aligns well with our results on the actual
involvement of local people in the different stages of PEM efforts
(cf. Fig. 2).

Local communities’ main interest in participation reflected a
representative type of participation (60%, n = 40), i.e., that they

were interested in having leverage to shape the project. For
example, local communities appreciated having an active role in
natural resource management (e.g., Gaidet et al. 2003, Kofinas et
al. 2003, Bell and Harwood 2012). In many cases, local
communities were also reported as being interested in having their
knowledge being appreciated by external actors and perceiving
that such knowledge could serve for resource conservation (e.g.,
Tengberg et al. 1998, Noss and Cuéllar 2001, Oba et al. 2007) and
regulation (e.g., Newman and LeDrew 2005, Mutimukuru et al.
2006). Few communities’ interests denoted a nominal type of
participation (15%, n = 10), i.e., they were interested in being
included to retain some access to potential benefits. For example,
some prevented opening new illegal shrimp farms (Vandergeest
2007) or perceived future economic benefits (Fabricius and Burger
1997, Rao et al. 1999). Perceptions reflecting instrumental
participation, i.e., a cost of time spent on project-related activities,
were rarely mentioned (7%, n = 5). Perceptions echoing
transformative participation were found in few studies (6%, n =
4), expressed in the ability to decide and act for themselves. For
example, local actors often felt empowered (e.g., Constantino et
al. 2012) and capable of taking over responsibility for the PEM
process (e.g., Rennaud et al. 2012); although this was not always
the case (Brooks and Tshering 2010).

However, because only 40 studies (20% of the 119 documents)
mentioned the perceptions of the local communities regarding
PEM, it is possible that negative perspectives remain
undocumented. It seems likely that there is a reporting bias
because researchers reporting on PEM efforts they themselves
have implemented are less likely to document negative sentiments
of local communities who feel excluded or undercompensated.

The main views from the external organizations were that PEM
projects were effective for environmental conservation (e.g.,
Robinson et al. 2005, Danielsen et al. 2007, Saunders and
Bromwich 2012). They also perceived that PEM improved the
relations between the different natural resources’ users (e.g., Van
Rijsoort and Jinfeng 2005, Giordano et al. 2010). This suggests
that external organizations also use PEM projects as a functionalutilitarian tool to obtain information and the potential
improvement in protection through improved relations.

## CONCLUSION

Our review of studies on PEM projects published in peer-reviewed
journals showed that most of them are, in practice, controlled by
professionals and researchers. Local communities’ involvement is
reduced to data collection and they are rarely fully involved in the
initial stages of the projects, when the purpose and format of the
monitoring is decided. Their involvement in the analysis and use
stages is also low, potentially inhibiting the empowerment
potential of their participation.

Moreover, together with the low participation of local
communities, the short-term character of most PEM projects,
their technical framing, and the emphasis of researchers in
highlighting the cost-effectiveness of such projects suggest that
these sets of projects prioritize environmental monitoring over
participation. It is important to emphasize that these conclusions
are drawn on the basis of the information available in the studies
reviewed. But, we do not know how well the image presented in
these studies corresponds to the underlying reality of
participation and collaboration in PEM projects that have not
been reported in the literature. Neither do we know the intentions
and constraints met by the many hard-working scientists and local
people engaging in PEM efforts.

Nevertheless, we believe that our results should be of concern for
the research community engaged in PEM efforts, especially
because our results echo previous works showing that many
efforts labelled as participatory remain top-down or exclusive in
practice (Cooke and Kothari 2001, Cornwall 2008). The
discrepancy between rhetoric and practice should be of concern
for the research community for several reasons, instrumental as
well as idealistic. First, the differences in motivations and interests
between researchers and communities are likely to lead to
disappointment when local communities realize that their
interests are unlikely to be met, rendering PEM efforts short lived
(Shirk et al. 2012). Second, the discrepancy could contribute to
delegitimize the research community that engages poor, resourcedependent communities in data collection efforts where there
appears to be a distance between the discursive framing of the
effort, as participatory, and the practice of who gets to decide
what to monitor, how, and what the data can be used for.

For these reasons, we suggest that future PEM efforts should
carefully balance the promises associated with participatory
rhetoric with their intentions regarding participatory process in
practice. Efforts that do signal participation should emphasize
real engagement of local counterparts also in the ideation and
design phases. For example, PEM projects could incorporate the
idea of favoring the creation of self-reliant monitoring groups
that have the tools to decide, in alliance with professional
researchers, what is needed to be monitored, how, and in which
way they can use the data for their own management decisions
(see e.g., Topp-Jørgensen et al. 2005, Danielsen et al. 2013b,
Boissière et al. 2014). This could contribute to improve
communities’ involvement in the decision-making process and
potentially improve their socio-political outcomes. Finally, we
encourage researchers documenting PEM to be more systematic
about reporting their protocols, project’s long-term outcomes for
local communities (e.g., Funder et al. 2013), and to continue the
analysis of field projects that might not be documented in the
literature, for example autonomous local monitoring (e.g., Sheil
et al. 2015). Such efforts will help researchers understand better
the nature of each study, its implications, and possibly become a
tool for increasing future good practices in PEM efforts.
