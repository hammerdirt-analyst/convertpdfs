# MONITORING PLASTICS IN RIVERS AND LAKES: Guidelines for the Harmonization of Methodologies

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this report is to provide guidelines for the assessment of plastic contamination, from macro- to 
microplastics, in freshwater environments. It provides the most current procedures for monitoring and analysing 
plastic content in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and water/wastewater treatment plants. In addition, recommendations 
are made based on a series of workshops for water managers and other stakeholders. A project group, 
consisting of seven experts in different fields, was created with the direct goal of developing guidelines for 
plastic monitoring in freshwater. The project group was co-led and funded by the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP).

This report is intended to reach local, national, intergovernmental and international organizations which are 
responsible for or have an interest in understanding and/or managing plastic waste within any of the varying 
freshwater environments. There is also an intention that, by providing a guidance document for monitoring 
and assessment methods, these procedures will be widely utilized and become a standard protocol. Such 
harmonization would allow monitoring programmes and subsequent results to be easily compared, leading to 
a growing database of knowledge and understanding of plastic waste in freshwater. Proper actions, mandates 
and laws could then be developed to assist national authorities and regional groups.

### Plastic contamination in freshwater environments

One reason these guidelines are important is that most plastic debris research is currently focused on the 
oceans (Blettler et al. 2018). Consequently, the available sampling techniques and protocols have been developed 
for marine systems. They can possibly be applied in freshwater environments but may need adaptation to 
freshwater conditions including the fast-moving waters of rivers and streams, a higher sediment content, 
different biota and a higher incidence of micro- and nanoplastics, to name a few. The differences between 
freshwater and marine systems are mostly limited to sampling techniques. Many freshwater-specific factors 
affect sampling procedures more than the actual (laboratory) analysis, which tends to be similar to the analysis 
of seawater samples.

### From oceans to land

To address the widespread and increasing problem of plastic contamination, most attention and research thus 
far have been directed to marine ecosystems. However, when investigating the origin of plastic debris in the 
oceans it is widely assumed that 80 per cent of this debris comes from land-based sources although this is 
currently poorly supported by data (Andrady 2011, Jambeck et al. 2015). The amount of land-based plastic 
entering the oceans each year has been estimated to be ~ 9 million metric tons (Jambeck et al. 2015), with one 
of the major pathways being riverine export at about 2 million metric tons per year (Lebreton et al. 2017; Schmidt, 
Krauth and Wagner 2017). This kind of estimate is subject to large uncertainties since observation networks 
for monitoring plastic in freshwaters are small and sporadic, with heterogeneous methodologies. Yet current 
knowledge about plastic contamination in freshwater suggests that this contamination is as widespread as in 
the marine environment.

### Macro- and microplastics

Microplastics, specifically defined in Chapter 3, have gained considerable attention since the pioneering study by 
Thompson et al. (2004). In freshwater, microplastics are typically far more abundant (particle count per volume) 
than larger debris. In terms of mass concentrations (mass per volume), data from river studies suggest that 
microplastics and larger items broadly contribute equally to the total mass concentration (Schmidt, Krauth and 
Wagner 2017). Thus, monitoring programmes should ideally capture the entire size spectrum of plastic particles.

### Reservoirs and lakes

Damming of rivers may significantly alter downstream transport of plastic debris (Lebreton et al. 2017). This is 
particularly significant for large rivers (average discharge above 1,000 m3 s−1), of which 46.7 per cent are affected 
by damming. In addition to the role of reservoirs in intercepting downstream plastic transport, those used for 
fisheries/aquaculture or drinking water abstraction are susceptible to the impacts of plastic contamination.

### Wastewater treatment plants

Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are considered a steady pathway for microplastic particles in 
rivers (Kay et al. 2018), notwithstanding that a considerable fraction of the plastic in raw sewage is typically 
retained during the treatment process. Reported removal efficiencies range between 72 per cent (Leslie et al. 2017) 
and 99 per cent (Talvitie et al. 2017). The majority of observed removal rates are above 95 per cent 
(Murphy et al. 2016; Lares et al. 2018; Simon et al. 2018). If sewage sludge is later applied as fertilizer, plastic 
particles retained during the sewage treatment process can be re-released. Raw sewage which enters river 
networks through combined sewer overflows during intense rain or through sewers generally not connected to 
a WWTP contains plastic debris which is not restricted to microplastics.

### Drinking water

Microplastics have been detected in tap water and bottled water. However, lack of standardization of microplastics 
sampling and analysis results in large differences among different studies (Koelmans et al. 2019). For a risk 
assessment, improved reproducibility and comparability of results are needed.

### Freshwater plastic monitoring – learning from marine plastic monitoring and new challenges

Monitoring methods for freshwater can benefit from the large body of knowledge and experience gained 
from marine plastic monitoring. For example, methods of sample processing and instrumental analytics for 
physical and chemical particle characterization are the same for freshwater and marine systems. However, 
other aspects require adaptation to specific freshwater conditions. One example is the typically higher content 
of coarse natural particulate material such as wood, leaves or seeds, and fine particles such as microalgae or 
clay minerals compared to the marine environment. Thus, sample preparation and analysis must be designed 
to handle the large non-plastic particle fraction in freshwater samples. 

In the open oceans the challenge for representative monitoring lies mainly in the large area to be monitored. In 
rivers, concentrations of particulate material often depend on discharges. There is a tendency for concentrations 
to increase due to first flush effects and the addition and mobilization of more material as discharge increases. 
Generally, sedimentation and resuspension of particles are important processes in freshwater bodies (Kooi et 
al. 2018). Monitoring programmes must be designed to adequately capture variations in plastic concentrations 
in freshwater systems. Moreover, monitoring must properly support the identification and quantification of point 
and diffuse sources of plastics in freshwater in order to prioritize intervention measures.

## Definitions and terminology

In this report the term “plastic debris” applies to all sizes of plastic particles. Although science and policy use 
similar terminology, there is no agreed or official text setting out exactly how to categorize plastic debris. 
Therefore, the terminology used in this report follows that of GESAMP (2019).
Plastic debris
Plastics are synthetic organic polymers with thermoplastic or thermoset properties (synthesized from 
hydrocarbon or biomass raw materials), elastomers (e.g. butyl rubber), material fibres, monofilament lines, 
coatings and ropes. Many plastics are produced as a mixture of different polymers and various plasticizers, 
colorants, stabilizers and other additives. About 80 percent of plastics production in Europe comprises 
polyethylene (PE) (both high-density \[HDPE\] and low density \[LDPE\]), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), polyurethane (PUR), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Packaging represents the 
dominant market sector for plastics (39.9 percent), followed by building and construction (19.8 per cent) and 
automotive (9.9 per cent) (PlasticsEurope 2019).

### Size categories

The sizes and shapes of plastic particles are the main properties which should be captured in sampling and 
analysis procedures. At the same time, sampling procedures must be appropriate for the targeted particle size. 
Particles less than 5 mm in size are commonly referred to as microplastics, whereas the terms meso-, macro-, 
and megaplastics are used to describe larger particles (Table 3.1). The sub-categories defining larger plastic 
particles are not often used in the literature. As a consequence, these guidelines only refer to the categories 
macro-, micro- and nanoplastics. A recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) report defines 
large microplastics as particles 1–5 millimetres (mm) in size. Nanoplastics are generally defined as particles 
smaller than or equal to 100 nanometres (nm) (Besseling et al. 2019). A size threshold of 500 micrometres (µm) 
is often applied to differentiate between large and small microplastics (e.g. Mintenig et al. 2017; Haave et al. 
2019). When mass-based analysis of microplastics is attempted, it is reasonable to divide the sample into even 
more size fractions (cut-off at 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10 and 5 µm; Braun et al. 2018). This report provides a rough 
estimate of average particle mass in each size class.

### Morphology categories

The shapes of plastic debris are important indicators of their origin and their state of fragmentation or 
disintegration. Shape definitions are mainly important in the case of particles less than 1 centimetre (cm) in 
size. Since larger particles often occur as whole items or larger fragments, it may be possible to categorize them 
according to their origin (e.g. bottles, bags or straws). For shape categorization of plastic debris in freshwater, 
the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) guidelines for marine litter can be used (Annex III in  
GESAMP 2019).

As with size categories, there is currently no standardized scheme for different shapes of plastic debris. However, 
the five shape categories used for marine litter, according to GESAMP 2019, can be readily applied to freshwater 
environments. These microplastic morphologies are identified as 1) fragments, 2) fibres/filaments, 3) beads/
spheres, 4) films/sheets, and 5) pellets (Table 3.1).


## Designing monitoring programmes for freshwater environments 

### Transferring from marine systems – similarities and differences between marine and freshwater systems

Research, as well as public interest, have long focused on plastic contamination in oceans and coastal areas. 
However, there is increasing awareness that a considerable amount of marine plastic contamination originates 
from land-based sources. Rivers, for example, have been shown to deliver large amounts of plastic debris 
into the marine environment (Lebreton et al. 2017). It can therefore be asserted that freshwater systems are 
also impacted by plastic contamination, with reservoirs intended for the production of drinking water being 
particularly susceptible to elevated plastic concentrations.

Plastic debris monitoring in freshwater systems can rely on a large body of expertise gained in marine 
monitoring programmes. There is already a wealth of experience with sampling techniques, analytical methods, 
and the design of monitoring programmes in the marine environment. Freshwater plastic debris monitoring 
should build on this experience and adapt techniques, concepts and protocols to meet specific needs. 
In many cases, methods and protocols for the characterization of plastic debris can be directly transferred 
from marine to freshwater applications. This is relevant for classification schemes (size and morphology), 
particle counting methods, and the chemical characterization of contaminant particles by polymer type. At 
the beginning of an assessment, it should be defined whether the primary focus is quantification of plastic 
hotspots, sources, sinks and flows in a catchment, or the assessment of possible risks and effects in freshwater 
ecological communities (Figure 4.1). It is highly recommended to measure the dimensions of particles when  
microscope-based methods are used, so that a rough estimate of polymer mass can be derived in addition to 
plastic particle concentration.

Monitoring of the marine environment includes shorelines, the water surface and column, and seafloor sediments. 
Each of these compartments can be sampled using a specific method. Freshwater environments are more 
diverse, and sampling strategies have to be adapted to conditions at the specific site. A large river, for instance, 
requires a different sampling design than a small stream. While sampling of large rivers can be conducted from 
a vessel and may require several monitoring points along the cross-section, a small stream can be sampled from 
the bank or by wading. A major step prior to laboratory analysis of microplastic particles is sample preparation, 
mostly to remove organic material. Typically, in freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes the content of 
particulate organic material (e.g. leaves, branches) is higher than in the marine environment. In rivers and lakes 
this material is freshly received from the banks while in the marine environment it is typically already broken 
down. A general scheme of how to develop a monitoring programme, from identifying the objectives aligned with 
available resources to its implementation, is shown in Figure 4.2.

###	 Developing a monitoring programme – how to start?

The majority of the world’s rivers remain ungauged with respect to plastic contamination. To date, no regularly 
operating plastic monitoring programmes exist. To further complicate matters, there is no general “off the shelf” 
solution for establishing a monitoring programme. Developing and implementing an environmental monitoring 
programme generally comprises three phases: a development phase, a design phase and an implementation 
phase (Fig. 4.2). These phases are the same for plastics as for any other substance of concern. The development 
phase identifies the objectives or research questions and aligns these with the available resources. Getting 
the monitoring started has the highest priority. For example, in rivers floating, macroplastics can be observed 
from bridges and manually counted, involving citizen scientists without the need for extensive preparation, a 
laboratory or costly sampling equipment. The objectives of a project can be many and varied, so a “one size fits 
all” recommendation does not exist. Figure 4.2 shows some typical examples, although there are many more. 
The second phase - the design phase – specifies the compartments, the sampling locations and frequencies, as 
well as the sampling and analysis techniques. However, for the second phase there is no blueprint that can be 
easily applied at every location. A few, key guiding principles should generally be considered:

1. If possible, plastic monitoring should be integrated into existing monitoring programmes. This allows 
using already available metadata (e.g. river discharge, typical fish populations) and an efficient use of 
resources (travel cost). If available, existing regional plastic assessments (e.g. see https://wedocs.unep.org/
handle/20.500.11822/33519) should also be considered for maximum consistency of information.
2. Plastic concentrations and plastic loads can be highly variable over time. This time variation can provide 
useful information on the mechanisms of plastic transport. For instance, in rivers, increasing concentrations 
with increasing river discharge can be an indication of remobilization of material already present in the river 
channel. Thus, it is generally recommended to focus on relatively frequent and long-term monitoring at fewer 
locations rather than measuring sporadically at many locations.
3. Generally, simpler and cost-effective methods should be preferred in order to be able to capture more data 
rather than fewer samples for advanced and costly analysis. In general, the effort required to monitor plastics 
increases with decreasing particle size. Thus, if appropriate, a monitoring programme should be designed 
starting from macroplastics.

The third phase is implementation. It is recommended to start with a pilot phase with a limited number of locations 
to test the workflows and the selected techniques. A pilot phase will help to evaluate whether the monitoring 
design is appropriate. Almost as important (see Section 11.5.2 Metadata) is the collection of metadata which 
make it possible to put the plastic data in context. Note that a final monitoring strategy can comprise several 
components with varying spatiotemporal scales, for example, (1) long-term monitoring focused on seasonal 
dynamics, and (2) targeted intensive monitoring efforts of limited duration focused on diurnal dynamics or 
quantifying the response to hydrological events.

### Choosing the optimal methods

The choice of sampling and observation methods should optimally fit the objectives of the monitoring 
programme and the available resources. Table 4.1 provides a scoring scheme of the sampling and observation 
methods covered in this report in terms of the cost of the equipment for observation, sampling and analysis, 
the infrastructure to run and maintain the equipment (e.g. instrumental analytical methods require adequate 
laboratories facilities to be operated), the efforts required for installing the equipment in the field or the lab and 
the requirements in terms of skilled female and male personnel who conduct the monitoring and analysis. We 
recommend starting monitoring by selecting methods with low scores, with a monitoring programme that will 
keep the start-up costs low.

### Precautions against sample contamination
When sampling or processing samples of microplastics, precautions should be taken against sample 
contamination. Microplastics have been detected almost everywhere. They can be transported through the 
air (Bergmann et al. 2019) or released from clothing during normal wear, among other sources. The smaller 
the plastic particle size one wishes to detect, the more critical are the procedures to avoid (or at least trace) 
contamination.
Initially, anyone involved in sampling should take these protective measures:
1. Wear clothing made of natural fibres during sampling where possible;
2. Use cotton lab coats during laboratory work;
3. Use nitrile gloves and change them frequently.
4. 
Furthermore, the materials and reagents for microplastic research should be chosen and treated carefully:

1. Avoid plastic equipment during sample handling and switch to metals (stainless steel, aluminium) or 
glassware instead. If this is not possible, use polymers that are not widely found in the environment, e.g. 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). (Cost should be considered, as rarer 
plastics tend be more expensive). The use of non-plastic containers also prevents chemical contamination 
by plastic-associated substances (see Chapter 9). If plastic containers have to be used, a piece of aluminium 
foil may be placed between the vessel and the lid to avoid abrasion. Keep samples of the plastic materials 
you use in order to be able to identify their spectra later.
2. Clean vials or equipment with filtered water or ethanol and adapt the filter type to the desired microplastics 
det
3. ection level (e.g. use at least 0.45 µm filters to detect particles down to a size of 1 µm). Reagents used to 
treat samples also have to be filtered.
4. Keep sampling devices, sample containers and reagent vessels closed as much as possible. If possible, 
handle samples and reagents on a clean bench. The installation of air cleaners, such as portable dust boxes, 
is also advisable.

Current research shows that completely preventing any contamination is practically impossible (e.g. Koelmans 
et al. 2019). Contamination by small fibres is common. If contamination is never detected, the sampling 
procedure is likely not working properly. It is therefore recommended to run procedural blanks to trace how 
much and where contamination occurs. This means the whole sampling and extraction procedure is imitated 
without a real sample. In the case of large water samples, filtered drinking water or ultrapure water can be used 
as a surrogate. In the field, glass fibre filters can be attached to the sampling equipment or containers and can 
be analysed later for airborne particles. 

During sample handling in the lab, empty containers can be opened and treated with reagents in the same 
manner as those containing samples. In the end, whether the contaminating particles can be distinguished 
from the real sample particles by microscopy and/or spectroscopic methods has to be evaluated. If they 
cannot, their concentrations have to be subtracted from the particle concentrations in the samples. If they 
can be distinguished, a more specific procedure may be applied. In any case, concentrations and types of 
contamination must be documented and possible sources should be identified.

## Sampling and observation
This chapter provides guidance on sampling the three key matrices of freshwater environments: water, sediments 
and biota. Water consists of the water surface and the water column of lakes and rivers. The discussion of 
sediments focuses on lake and riverbed sediments. This includes sampling from the shorelines of lakes and 
rivers. Because they are easily accessible, lake and river shorelines often benefit from clean-up actions. Relevant 
data can be used for monitoring and linked to citizen science projects. The biota to be sampled comprise 
invertebrates, fish and birds. As freshwater is a major drinking water resource, the report includes sampling 
of drinking water and wastewater. Guidance is provided for sampling wastewater along the treatment process 
from raw sewage sludge to the final effluent from wastewater treatment plants. 
Depending on the sampled water body and the intended spectrum of particle sizes, the volume of water 
necessary to obtain a representative sample will vary. The general solids content is crucial. Table 5.1 suggests 
appropriate sample sizes for the quantification of small microplastics (1 to approximately 50 µm).

Macroplastic debris sampling is a straightforward and intuitive monitoring strategy. Often nets are used to collect 
riverine litter, which is subsequently analysed in the field or the lab. To date, most assessments have focused on 
sampling floating plastics or plastics in the upper 1.5 m of the water column. Sampling can have two main goals: 
debris is collected to analyse composition, polymer type, item type, size and mass distribution; or sampling 
is carried out to determine the plastic concentration at given points in space and time. Plastic concentration 
Cp (kg/m3) can be calculated using collected plastic mass Mp (kg), sampled water volume V (m3), river discharge at sampling net Q (m3/s), 
sampling net opening An (m2), flow velocity u (m/s) and sampling duration t (s). The variables that should be 
considered in designing a sampling-based monitoring strategy for surface and water column sampling are discussed below.

### Deployment method

Sampling nets can be deployed using various methods, including boats (Sadri and Thompson 2014), lifting cranes 
on bridges (Moore, Lattin and Zellers 2011; Hohenblum et al. 2015), direct deployment from riverbanks (Moore, Lattin 
and Zellers 2011) and direct deployment from bridges (Rech et al. 2014; van Emmerik et al. 2018; van Emmerik et al. 
2019c). In smaller, shallow rivers and streams nets can be deployed manually by wading (Baldwin et al. 2016). Direct 
deployment from riverbanks and bridges is done using relatively small and lightweight nets that can be handled by 
one or two persons. The advantages include rapid and flexible deployment, as no additional equipment or machinery 
is required. However, these deployment methods strongly depend on the availability of safe deployment sites on 
bridges or accessible riverbanks (Rech et al. 2015). The sampling volume and mass are also limited by the maximum 
load those handling the nets can handle, which is generally in the order of several kilograms for flow velocities around 
1 m per second. Deployment from riverbanks has the additional disadvantage that only a limited part of the cross-
section can be sampled. As the horizontal distribution of plastic transport can vary considerably (e.g. van Emmerik 
et al. 2018), this may result in unrepresentative samples. Net sampling from bridges has been done using nets with 
multiple layers, also in order to sample at deeper layers of the water column (van Emmerik et al. 2019a; van Emmerik 
et al. 2019b). However, the forces on the sampling net can become difficult to manage in the case of increased flow 
velocities, which may lead to poor execution of sampling protocols. Manual deployment of nets by wading into a 
river allows exact positioning with respect to depth and along the cross-section. In wadable rivers, nets can easily be 
deployed and remain unsupervised for some time if they are fixed at the riverbed by an anchor.

A way to overcome this problem is to deploy sampling nets using boats or cranes. Assessments of plastic 
transport in rivers in Los Angeles (United States) (Moore, Lattin and Zellers 2011) and in the Danube (Austria) 
(Hohenblum et al. 2015) used cranes to deploy sampling nets from bridges (Figure 5.2). With such equipment 
the maximum load imposed by collected debris mass and flow velocity can be considerably heavier than in the 
case of direct deployment. In both these examples that was the case Moore, Lattin and Zellers (2011) assessed 
the increase in plastic transport in response to torrential rain events in the Los Angeles basin. Hohenblum et al. 
(2015) deployed a three-layered netting system to collect plastic debris at the surface, in the middle of the water 
column, and right above the riverbed. For such assessments deployment with cranes is absolutely necessary. 
The disadvantages include the need for additional equipment and space on bridges or riverbanks. 
Sampling from boats is the most common plastic sampling method in the open ocean. Several assessments 
have deployed nets using boats in rivers across continental Europe (van der Wal et al. 2015) and in the United 
Kingdom (Sadri and Thompson 2014). The greatest advantage of using boats is that one can sample at any 
safe location on a river without being limited to suitable bridges. In contrast to other methods, this allows plastic 
sampling in estuaries (e.g. Sadri and Thompson 2014), which may shed light on actual plastic emissions from 
rivers into the ocean. Sampling can be carried out by transecting the river longitudinally, in cross-section or in a 
figure-eight shape (van der Wal et al. 2015), or by maintaining the same location during the sampling (stationary 
sampling). The latter yields similar results as bridge-deployed sampling. In contrast to the marine environment 
(Kukulka et al. 2012), boat sampling in rivers has not been widely applied to date. Lenaker et al. (2019) successfully 
used boat sampling from multiple depths of the water column in rivers and lakes.
Figure 5.2. Sampling a large river (the Danube) by crane from a bridge. An array of nets is positioned to sample the water 
surface and the water columns simultaneously (Hohenblum et al. 2015).

Miscellaneous sampling methods have been applied to collect plastic debris in rivers. Morritt et  al. (2014) 
investigated plastic transport at deeper layers in the water column of the Thames in the United Kingdom by 
deploying fish fykes just above the riverbed. No results from similar assessments have been reported to date. 
Riverine plastic debris that accumulated at dedicated infrastructure, for example in the Seine in France (Gasperi 
et al. 2014) and at Jones Falls in the United States (Lindquist 2016), has been collected. For these assessments 
no additional infrastructure was required. However, locations where plastic could be sampled were limited.

### Net dimensions

Net dimensions are crucial variables that influence results. This includes the height and depth of the frame, how 
deeply the frame is submerged, net length and net mesh size. Height and depth determine the sampling area of 
the net, which in turn determines the maximum size of the debris that can be sampled. Choosing a net opening 
is always a balance between sample size and the effort required to operate the net. Generally, macroplastic 
sampling nets tend not to exceed 1 m in height or width. Examples of nets used include 1.0 x 0.5 m2 (Saigon, Viet 
Nam; van Emmerik et al. 2018), 0.67 x 0.5 m2 (Jakarta waterways, Indonesia; van Emmerik et al. 2019a), 0.6 x 0.3 
m2 and 0.6 x 0.6 m (the Danube, Austria; Hohenblum et al. 2015), 0.5 x 0.15 m2 (the River Tamar, United Kingdom; 
Sadri and Thompson 2014), 0.27 x 0.105 m2 (Chilean rivers; Rech et al. 2014). 
The size distributions of collected debris can give additional insight into the net opening size that may be 
most appropriate given the scope of the assessment. Deployment depth, and the depth to which the frame 
is submerged, also influence the sampling results. More submerged plastic can be sampled when nets are 
installed at greater depths. However, in some cases it is crucial to allow some space between the water surface 
and the top of the net. In rivers with large amounts of floating plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
bottles and expanded polystyrene (EPS) foams, a net that is too deep will be unable to capture them.
Net length determines the drag force on the net and the maximum debris collection capacity. For rivers with 
high plastic concentrations and/or high flow velocities (e.g. the Jakarta rivers; van Emmerik et al. 2019a) it is 
recommended to use smaller nets in case they are deployed from bridges without additional equipment. This 
implies that the duration of sampling should be shorter, as the maximum capacity will be reached more quickly. 
Longer nets are advised when sampling duration is longer and when, for example, cranes or a larger number of 
people are available to retrieve the nets.
Mesh size influences the lower size limit of items that can be collected. Smaller mesh sizes determine the 
force on the sampling net. During periods of increased flow velocity, a too small mesh size can result in a 
backwater curve in front of the net opening. Debris may then be diverted away from the net, while the sample 
retrieved becomes less representative of the actual riverine debris concentration and composition. Mesh sizes 
used for macroplastic debris reported in the literature range between 300 μm (Sadri and Thompson 2014) and 
4 cm (van Emmerik et al. 2018). Choosing the best mesh size, as in the case of other variables, is an iterative 
process. The more size distribution statistics are collected for a specific river, the better the mesh size can be 
selected. Harmonization of the mesh sizes used is recommended, although there are often practical reasons to 
select another size. It is most important that the mesh size used is clearly reported, so that the results and size 
distribution can be interpreted consistently.

### Depth

Most macroplastic monitoring efforts focus on floating and suspended plastic debris in the upper 1.5 m of 
the water column. Data on (and understanding of) the vertical distribution of plastic debris are lacking. The 
distribution of plastic in the water column is related to the buoyancy, shape and degree of degradation of the 
plastic, river morphological characteristics and the hydrological regime. However, it remains difficult to predict 
the vertical profile of plastic debris for a given river without in situ data. Plastic debris at lower layers may make 
up a considerable share of total plastic transport. Morritt et al. (2014) collected plastic just above the riverbed, 
but no reference measurements were made at the surface. One of the few efforts to quantify a profile along 
the water column demonstrated that 66-79 per cent of total plastic transport may be below a depth of 1.5 m 
(Hohenblum et al. 2015). Recently, sampling of plastic in the upper 1.3 m showed that in the upper layer the clear 
majority (88 per cent) was transported in the upper 0.5 m (van Emmerik et al. 2019a). Sampling at deeper layers 
requires more costly and labour-intensive methods. 

### Deployment location

Choosing a deployment location depends on the question that an assessment or monitoring effort is focused 
on. To date, the focus has mainly been on estimating plastic transport for a given river cross-section or plastic 
emissions from a river into an ocean. For river export into the oceans the optimal deployment location should be 
as close to the river mouth as possible. As estuaries are wider towards the river mouth, suitable infrastructure for 
plastic sampling close to the mouth is often lacking. For example, in the Saigon River the suitable measurement 
location closest to the river mouth was still 70 km away (van Emmerik et al. 2018). Other methods to monitor 
plastic emissions (e.g. boat-based sampling, drones) are therefore likely to be more suitable. Note that estuaries 
are subject to complex flow dynamics, as they are influenced by both the tide and the freshwater discharge. 
Flow velocity and direction may change on hourly timescales, which in turn influence plastic transport and 
export into the ocean. Monitoring at the river mouth gives the best estimate of actual export to the sea. However, 
these can only be made in a meaningful way if the complex dynamics are taken into account, for example 
through high-frequency monitoring during targeted time periods. In rivers with deltas, it is hardly feasible to 
design a representative monitoring programme. It is recommended to select a location upstream of the deltaic 
section of the river.
For bridge-based net sampling, it is recommended to find bridges with a sidewalk separated from motorized 
traffic. Determining a sampling location across the width of the river depends on the purpose of sampling. 
It can either be done to obtain debris statistics such as material (organic, plastic, other), polymer type, mass 
and size distribution, or to quantify the cross-sectional variation of plastic debris concentration. If sampling is 
mainly carried out to obtain bulk statistics, the location with the highest plastic concentration can be sampled. 
To measure the cross-sectional variation, other variables determine the number of sampling locations, such as 
variation in flow velocity, navigational activity (if it is unsafe to sample in the navigation route), sampling duration 
and available workforce.

### Sampling duration and frequency

Macroplastic debris transport can exhibit large temporal variations on seasonal, daily and subdaily scales. 
Appropriate sampling duration and frequency may be chosen depending on the purpose of the assessment.

Typical deployment durations vary between minutes (Moore et al. 2011) and 24 hours (Wagner et al. 2019), but 
depend on the mode of operation. If sampling is done manually, deployment durations are generally in the order 
of minutes to hours. For longer deployment, set-ups are recommended that can be operated without continuous 
supervision, for example by using litter traps or fixed nets. The deployment duration of nets depends on the debris 
loading of both plastics and other components, such as organic material and suspended sediment. Deployment 
times must be sufficiently long to capture material, but must be short enough to avoid full clogging or blocking 
of the net opening. Rapid clogging of nets or filters in rivers with high organic material loads or high suspended 
sediment loads may prevent these types of sampling techniques. In such cases visual counting might be more 
appropriate. In general, deployment times will need to be adjusted for each individual sampling location and 
potentially for individual samplings in rivers with high load variations. The sampling frequency is determined by 
the objectives of the monitoring programme and the available resources. It is recommended to take samples 
under different flow conditions as plastic loads can depend on river dynamics, which can be variable at different 
time scales. Close to the river mouth, the flow dynamics are influenced by both freshwater discharge and the 
tide. Depending on their relative contributions, this may lead to changes in flow velocity and direction multiple 
times per day. Other river systems, such as intermittent streams are not always easy to forecast, may show large 
variations across seasons. In extreme cases, rivers may run dry for several months. Both examples emphasize 
the importance of taking into account river flow dynamics in the design of a river plastic monitoring strategy. As 
river flow dynamics, such as hourly tidal dynamics or the exact onset date of a first flush in intermittent stream, 
are not always easy to forecast, this should be anticipated in river plastic monitoring. In the case of strong 
hourly variations, it is recommended to plan several high frequency sampling sessions, for example, hourly 
measurements during a full tidal cycle. For intermittent streams, a strategy could combine standard weekly or 
monthly measurements, combined with flexible measurements based on the rainfall and discharge forecasts. 
Note that measurements of zero plastic flow (due either to no plastics or to no river discharge) are also valuable 
data that gives important insights in the plastic transport dynamics of that very river system.

### Sample analysis protocol

Once the sample is collected, it can be analysed in the field or in the lab. If one is interested in general riverine 
debris characteristics, it is recommended to separate the sample into organic material, plastic litter and remaining 
debris. Depending on the extent of the assessment, the remaining debris can then be separated into additional 
classes, but that is beyond the scope of this report. Plastic litter can be categorized through advanced analysis 
such as Raman spectrometry (which can determine the exact plastic polymer type) or the use of lookup tables. 
Advanced analysis is difficult to perform in the field and equipment is expensive. There are several methods for 
simplified analysis. 
The OSPAR method (OSPAR 2010) includes a list with standard categories of items that can be used to categorize 
sampled debris. The advantage of this method is that it is standardized, which allows easy comparison with 
data from other rivers or sampling efforts. The OSPAR methodology has recently been adapted for freshwater 
by Schone Rivieren (Clean Rivers; see annex 3). An even simpler method proposed by van Emmerik et al. (2018) 
categorizes sampled plastic into seven categories (PET, PS, EPS, PP/PE-soft, PP/PE-hard, Multilayer, Other) 
based on a lookup table. The advantages include easy application, first order estimation of the polymer type, 
and a limited number of categories. A disadvantage is that items may be categorized wrongly. Once categorized, 
the mass and item count of each category can be measured. Note that when the mass is determined directly 
after retrieval, it equals the wet mass. For the dry mass it is recommended to dry the plastic items for at least  
24 hours at 70 degrees, or to sun dry them for at least 72 hours.

### Tracking methods

Tracking the travel paths of plastic items is a common monitoring method which is often unreported. There are 
two main categories: active tracking using a global positioning system (GPS), and passive tracking by releasing 
marked items that can be reported once retrieved. Active tracking is an accurate method of following plastic debris 
in river systems. GPS trackers can be placed in typical macroplastic items such as water bottles (e.g. Tramoy et 
al. 2019). Additional mass can be added to decrease the tracker’s buoyancy and ensure that it is submerged just 
below the water surface. The energy demand of GPS trackers depends on the data-sending frequency. Some 
trackers can enter sleep mode when no movement is registered. With such settings, trackers may last multiple 
months. A GPS tracker should not be submerged too deeply, as it will then not be able to send signals. 
Since GPS trackers are easily lost or stolen, using them can be costly. Some researchers mark typical macroplastic 
items that can be tracked passively. For example, Ivar do Sul et al. (2014) used painted plastic items to quantify 
the retention time of plastic debris in mangrove forests. Others have placed QR codes or contact information on 
plastic items. If citizens or professionals find these items, the location can be reported. Tracking plastic items 
can provide insights into the travel paths and times of plastic debris in river systems. However, it does not allow 
quantification of plastic concentrations or plastic transport at given points in space or time.

### Visual observation methods

As most macroplastic observations to date have been carried out using varying methods, the Riverine and 
Marine floating macro litter Monitoring and Modelling of Environmental Loading (RIMMEL) project has aimed 
to harmonize riverine plastic litter data collection (Gonzalez et al. 2016; González-Fernández and Hanke 2017). 
Rather than sampling or tracking the plastic, plastic litter transport can be quantified through visual observations 
from bridges. Using the same protocol in each river, consistent observations of floating plastic litter can be made 
in terms of time and space. An example is a recent synthesis of visual observation data for over 20 rivers in Asia 
and Europe (van Calcar and van Emmerik 2019). The cross-section of a river is divided into sections, depending 
on the amount of plastic, measurement duration and river width. For each of these sections the number of 
plastic items observed during a given period is counted. This can then be normalized over time and space 
to arrive at a plastic transport profile over the river width and total plastic transport in items per unit of time 
(generally items per hour). River characteristics and bridges vary greatly. For each location, an exact protocol 
should be optimized. The aspects that should be considered are discussed below. Note that visual observations 
can be combined with physical sampling, for example to convert the measured transport in items per unit of 
time to actual mass transport (van Emmerik et al. 2018).

### Measurement location

Similar to plastic sampling, the nature of the assessment determines the optimal measurement location. For 
transport it is recommended to find a bridge close to the river mouth. In larger rivers, bridges close to the mouth 
are often not safe to work on due to their height or traffic intensity. The distance between the bridge and the water 
surface determines the minimum observable plastic item size. From experience, items larger than 1 cm can be 
observed at heights of around 10-14 m (van Emmerik et al. 2018). If smaller items should also be observed, or 
when only bridges a greater distance above the water surface are available, using binoculars is recommended. 
The height and width of the bridge also influence the width of the section that can be observed comfortably. 
Experience shows that a width equal to the observation height generally works well.
Visual observation methods are highly flexible in terms of discharge conditions and flow velocities as they only 
require optical contact to the water surface. While using sampling nets may not be feasible during high flows 
with high flow velocities and high debris loads, visual observations provided the observer is in a safe location 
can still be performed. 

### Site preparation

Preparing the measurement location includes dividing the bridge into sections, choosing the side on which to 
take measurements, and determining the sampling duration. Division of the bridge into sections depends on the 
number of people taking part in the sampling, the sampling frequency and the required spatial coverage. Having 
more sections allows better estimation of the cross-sectional transport profile, which may be important for 
optimizing waste reduction strategies. If only total plastic transport is important, fewer sections can be identified. 
Some examples of applications include the Saigon River (10 sections, 15 m wide, 60 per cent coverage; van 
Emmerik et al. 2018), the Jakarta waterways (four to 10 sections, 5 m wide, 100 per cent coverage; van Emmerik 
et al. 2019a), the Rhône (one sub-section, 60 per cent coverage; Castro-Jiménez et al. 2019), and the Seine (three 
sections, 30-40 m wide, 100 per cent coverage; van Emmerik et al. 2019c). 

### Sampling duration and frequency
Sampling duration and frequency depend on the variation in flow velocity and sections across a river’s width. 
For rivers with considerable variation in flow velocity, such as those in tidal zones, it is recommended to take 
measurements at least once per hour. The duration of each measurement should at the most be equal to one 
hour divided by the number of sections. The magnitude of plastic transport also influences optimal sampling 
duration. For rivers with more than 1,000 items per hour, it is recommended to measure one or two minutes 
per section. For rivers with less than 100 items per hour, it is recommended to measure at least 15 minutes per 
section.

### Counting protocol
In addition to counting the total number of plastic items per unit of time, trained observers can count items in 
specific plastic classes. This generally works well if two observers can measure at the same time. One observer 
reports the plastic types (e.g. OSPAR Schone Rivieren or seven categories from van Emmerik et al. 2018) (Annexes 
1 and 2) and the other reports the overall observation. For higher plastic transport rates (> 1,000 items per 
hour) this method becomes more strenuous and the likelihood of unobserved items increases. In that case it is 
recommend to count only the total number of plastic items. Additional measurements can be performed on a 
smaller sub-section to determine the count per selected category.

### Automated monitoring

Scaling up visual observations may be facilitated through the use of automated monitoring rather than manual 
counting by observers from bridges. For example, tools have recently been developed that use Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicles (UAVs) for beach litter monitoring (Martin et al. 2018). Geraeds et al. (2019) presented a monitoring 
protocol for macroplastics monitoring using UAVs for rivers. It was demonstrated that variations in time and 
space can be well quantified from UAV-based camera imagery. Further research will focus on the use of UAVs 
for long-term data collection of plastic litter in river systems. Another promising way forward is the use of 
cameras for automated plastic monitoring. Kylili et al. (2019) developed a deep learning-based approach to 
identify floating plastic debris in marine environments. For river systems such an approach would offer an 
unprecedented opportunity to collect long-term time series of plastic transport. A recent proof-of-concept study 
demonstrated the added value of camera-based automated monitoring of river plastics in Jakarta rivers (van 
Lieshout et al. 2020). A precision of almost 70 per cent was obtained. Furthermore, the results suggest that the 
number of plastics observers can count is limited, which is not the case with automated monitoring. Especially 
for peak plastic transport, camera-based monitoring may therefore be more reliable.

### Micro- and mesoplastics

Macroplastics can be monitored by sampling and/or by tracking and imaging methods. The latter can typically 
not be applied to micro- and mesoplastics, which must be monitored by sampling. Micro- and mesoplastics are 
often sampled concurrently by net sampling. Monitoring that specifically aims at these smaller fractions may 
make use of specifically adapted net design. Compared with marine studies, smaller manta trawls or neuston 
catamarans are used. Most studies apply nets with mesh sizes of around 300 µm. Samples are typically large, 
so that with a 30 cm manta trawl, 20-50 m3 of water can be sampled in 10-30 minutes. However, it has been 
found that using finer nets will detect more particles, especially fibres, although sample volumes will necessarily 
be lower with such an approach. Larger sampling volumes can be achieved by pump and filtration sampling, 
where water is pumped through a series of filters of decreasing mesh size. 

Studies targeting very small particles in rivers or streams are rare so far, but one catchment-wide assessment 
using 1 litre bottles combined with 0.45 µm filtration has been published (Barrows et al. 2018). That assessment 
included major contributions from trained citizens. This strategy should be developed further to obtain a better 
perspective on spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics in rivers.
In contrast to macroplastics, monitoring microplastic transport in situ is much more difficult. Current estimates 
are based, to a large extent, on theoretical considerations. The lateral and vertical structure of large rivers 
generally needs to be taken into account, which requires a modification of existing sampling equipment in order 
to sample different depths at the same time (Liedermann et al. 2018). Liedermann et al. (2018) also revealed a 
slight tendency of near-bank microplastic accumulation.

### River sediments

The consequence of temporal variations in flow is that the extension of shore sediments, as well as the depth 
of the water above riverbed sediments, can be variable. Floods may decrease microplastic concentrations on 
a catchment scale (Hurley et al. 2018). Therefore, the previous hydrological situation has to be known when 
judging microplastic concentrations in river sediments. River sediment deposits are much less stable than 
those in lake sediments. Sampling of undisturbed sediments cannot be achieved in most cases, and sediment 
thickness cannot be related to sedimentation time. No standard methodology for obtaining layered sediments 
from riverbeds has been established. Riverbed samples are therefore sampled by using metal spoons (as for 
shore samples) or different grab samplers, usually covering the top 10-15 cm of sediment. These samples are 
large enough (in the kilogram range) to obtain meaningful microplastic concentrations. 

### Sampling of lakes and reservoirs

Riverbank and lake shore sampling methodologies are often based on the OSPAR Guidelines for Monitoring Marine 
Litter on Beaches (OSPAR Commission 2010). The OSPAR method consists of two types of sample units: 1) a 
section parallel to the water, 100 m wide from the dunes to the water’s edge, where all litter items are registered; 
and 2) a section (parallel to the water) 1,000 m wide from the dunes to the water’s edge, where all items > 50 
cm are registered. An OSPAR survey is conducted four times per year. All beaches are monitored within the 
same two-week timeframe. Sampling is carried out one hour after the maximum daily water level. Especially in 
coastal sections of river systems, water levels can be influenced by tidal dynamics. This is less important for 
river sections with small or negligible water level variations. The sampled items are 1) picked up, 2) marked on a 
standardized datasheet, and 3) removed. Sampling locations are chosen based on the absence of any previous 
cleaning activities. Note that the standardized list of items that can be marked includes other litter categories in 
addition to plastics, such as metal and glass (see the Annexes).

Stichting De Noordzee adapted the beach OSPAR method for the Schone Rivieren (Clean Rivers) project to 
monitor riverbank plastics along Dutch rivers (van Emmerik et al. 2020). Surveys have two parts: a 100 m survey 
and a detailed survey. For the 100 m survey a trajectory parallel to the water is selected, from the water’s edge to 
the highest visible waterline or riparian vegetation. Surveyors walk along strips 1-3 m wide parallel to the water 
and pick up all the litter they see from walking height (i.e. not on their knees). All the litter picked up is identified 
and marked using the same item categories as the beach OSPAR. For the detailed survey, a sample of 50 cm x 
50 cm of the litter layer is taken at the high waterline. No sample is taken of the soil. The sample is taken away by 
the surveyor and all granulates are counted. Both surveys are conducted twice a year (autumn and spring), but 
there is no standardized timeframe during which the measurements should be carried out. All measurements 
are performed by citizen scientists trained by Stichting De Noordzee.

Swiss lake and river shores were monitored by Faure et al. (2015). Three shores were sampled per lake, with 
three replicates per shoreline. For each shoreline, 0.3 m x 0.3 m quadrats were drawn on the drift line. The top 
5 cm was sampled, yielding a sampling volume of 4.5 litres. Microplastics were sieved with a 300 µm sieve and 
separated into fractions of > 5 mm, > 1 mm and > 300 µm. Macroplastics and large microplastics were identified 
visually. Smaller particles were treated to remove organic matter. 

In Germany the shores of the Elbe, Weser, Rhine and Danube rivers were monitored during the Plastikpiraten 
(Plastic Pirates) project (Kiessling et al. 2019). A stretch of riverbank 20 m x 50 m was identified and separated 
into three zones: 1) one in daily contact with the river (water line to 5 m away), 2) one in irregular contact with the 
river (5-15 m away), and (3) one that had no contact with the river (further than 15 m). In each zone a sampling 
point was set up using a stick and 1.5 m of rope. The rope was used to demarcate a circle. All litter items within 
the circle were counted and identified. To make identification easier, litter items could be placed on a white cloth. 
Item classification was simplified compared to the OSPAR method and used seven material categories. Surveys 
were carried out in the fall and spring.

Klein, Worch and Knepper (2015) analysed microplastics on the shores of the Rhine. A sampling site of  
10-15 m parallel to the river was selected, in which 40 random points were chosen. At each point 30 cm2 of 
sediment, 2 cm deep, was scooped up with a metal spoon. All samples were assembled and homogenized to 
obtain a sample of approximately 3 kg. The sediment was dried, weighed and sieved using different mesh sizes. 
Samples were subsequently analysed following the Thompson et al. (2004) protocol. 
One of the few efforts to categorize all plastic size categories was made by Blettler et al. (2018). Samples 
for macro-, meso- and microplastic were collected on the shores of the Paraná River in South America. For 
macroplastics, two transects of 50 m x 5 m were identified. All macroplastics were collected and taken to the lab 
for further analysis. For mesoplastics, three 1 m2 quadrats were set out in the macroplastic transects. Collecting 
and sieving took place in the top 3 cm of the surface using a 5 mm sieve. The litter items were taken to the lab 
for further analysis. For microplastics the same protocol as Klein, Worch and Knepper (2015) was used. 
Most shoreline monitoring efforts involve walking on shores or beaches. Cowger et al. (2019) sampled plastic 
using kayaks. Sampling locations were not selected beforehand, and the only requirement was the absence of 
previous clean-up activities. Litter items were categorized as tires, metal, recyclables or garbage.


## Assessing sources, pathways and categories of plastics in freshwater bodies

### Categorization protocols
Plastic litter is categorized in the field or in the lab. Field categorization is mainly carried out for mesoplastics 
or larger particles, as they can be identified by (a trained) eye. The benefit of categorization in the field is that 
no additional equipment is required, and data collection can be achieved more easily through citizen science 
initiatives. However, observer biases may exist, especially if participants are not well trained. Categorization 
of microplastics generally takes place in the lab, as additional equipment is required. Several examples of 
categorization protocols, for use in the field and the lab, are discussed below.

### Field protocols

One of the most commonly used categorization protocols is the OSPAR beach litter classification guideline 
(OSPAR 2010). Beach stretches of either 100 m (all litter) or 1 km (only litter > 1.5 cm) are selected, and all litter 
(plastic and non-plastic) is categorized. There are 121 pre-defined item categories, including both plastic and 
non-plastic items. Recently this protocol was adapted for riverbank monitoring in Dutch rivers (van Emmerik et 
al. 2020). In that case only 100 m stretches are analysed, from the river edge to the upper side of the riverbank. 
All litter items are collected and classified in the field by citizen scientists. 
Several other studies use similar, although less extensive, categorization protocols. This is mainly to make 
data collection easier for citizen scientists. For example, Kiessling et al. (2019) categorized plastic waste on the 
banks of nearly all major German rivers with the help of over 5,500 schoolchildren. Litter was categorized as 
plastic, metal, glass, food and other. 
Rech et al. (2014) separated litter plastic based on buoyancy. Riverbank and floating items were classified as 
persistent buoyant (plastics, polystyrene and wood), short-time buoyant (cigarette butts, paper, carton, textile, 
rubber and other) and non-buoyant (concrete, pottery, glass and metal). A similar classification scheme can be 
adapted for plastics only.

For floating macroplastics, van Emmerik et al. (2018) and van Emmerik et al. (2019a) have proposed a 
categorization protocol with seven categories: PET (transparent plastic bottles), PS (products that contain 
consumables such as plates, cutlery and cups), EPS (foam objects such as lunch boxes and meat trays), POhard 
(bottle caps, containers and rigid plastics), POsoft (bags, foils and wrappings), Multilayer (packaging with multiple 
layers) and Rest (all other objects that do not belong to one of the other categories). This protocol allows fast 
processing of samples and still quantifies the main plastic categories. 

###	 Linking plastic contamination to catchment attributes

The movement of plastic through the natural environment is driven by hydrometeorological, topographical and 
anthropogenic factors. Sources of plastic contamination are strongly associated with human activity. Plastic 
loads in rivers have been found to show high correlations with, for example, population density, urbanization, 
wastewater treatment and waste management practices (Best 2019). Common sources include wastewater 
treatment plants, landfills, densely populated urban areas, and recreational areas along lakes and rivers. 
Several efforts have been made to construct a globally distributed estimate of plastic leakage into the natural 
environment. A recent study used available data on municipal solid waste generation and mismanaged waste 
fraction from the Waste Atlas (an interactive map with visualized waste management data) to provide a global 
mismanaged waste estimate with ~ 1 km2 resolution (Lebreton and Andrady 2019). Several studies have also 
identified clear point sources of direct dumping of plastic waste in river systems in Chile (Rech et al. 2015), 
Romania (Mihai 2018) and Germany (Kiessling et al. 2019).

Once plastic is in the natural environment or has accumulated in landfills, it is transported over land into lakes 
and rivers owing to several natural factors. Wind speed/direction has been suggested as a main driver of plastic 
transport on land (e.g. Windsor et al. 2019), although fundamental studies or observational data confirming 
this is still lacking. Plastic transport has also been found to increase in response to rainfall events (e.g. Bruge 
et al. 2018; Castro-Jiménez et al. 2019; Tramoy et al. 2019). Additional plastics may enter a freshwater system 
through increased surface run-off, especially in urban areas, or combined sewer overflow as a result of heavy 
rainfall.

Within river systems, plastic transport is mainly influenced by hydrological factors such as water level, flow 
velocity and river discharge. Positive relations between plastic transport and river discharge have been found 
in the Los Angeles River basin in the State of California (United States) (Moore, Lattin and Zellers 2011) and 
the Rhône River in France (Castro-Jiménez et al. 2019). Increased water levels may remobilize plastics that 
have accumulated on riverbanks and in riparian zones. Flow velocity determines transport rate and strongly 
influences horizontal distribution across a river’s width (van Emmerik et al. 2018; van Emmerik et al. 2019a). 
Plastic transport is often obstructed by human activities such as shipping and by hydraulic infrastructure. For 
example, dams and urban trash receptacles act as accumulation zones for larger plastic items (Lebreton et al. 
2017; Honingh et al. 2020).

Riverbanks, riparian vegetation, sediments and oceans are typical sinks of freshwater plastics. Due to water 
level variations, plastics (temporarily) accumulate on riverbanks. This may lead to daily and monthly depositions 
driven by the tide, with additional depositions due to extreme hydrological events. The latter also transport 
plastic items in riparian vegetation along a river. Plastic accumulates in sediments, which can be caused by 
its density or biofouling. The duration of plastic retention in sediments depends on shape size and density, as 
well as hydrological factors such as flow velocity. It has been demonstrated that the 2015 floods in the United 
Kingdom decreased sediment plastic concentration by 70 per cent (Hurley et al. 2018).
Large amounts of plastic are transported into the oceans. Many recent studies, using conceptual models, 
statistical models and/or measurements, have focused on estimating riverine plastic export. The best place 
to measure is in estuaries, where the river is connected to an ocean. However, most available quantification
methods are not well suited to quantify plastic transport in such areas. Only a few studies have focused on 
quantifying plastics in estuaries (e.g. Sadri and Thompson 2014). These studies have not estimated actual 
transport from the estuary to the ocean. 

## 	Relationship between plastic contamination and other forms of dissolved and particulate contamination

### Overview of contaminants

Contaminants, from either a natural source or anthropogenic activity, cause a range of problems in freshwater 
systems. The contaminants found there are typically categorized as, organic contaminants, pathogens, nutrients 
and agricultural run-off, suspended solids and sediments (organic and inorganic),  Inorganic contaminants (salts and metals),
thermal contamination, and 7) radioactive contaminants. Plastics or microplastics themselves are not classified as contaminants 
so far, although science-based initiatives in this regard are under way (e.g. Rochman 2013). 

Most contaminants that interact with plastics are either organic or inorganic compounds. Increasing attention 
is being given to interactions with other emerging contaminants (i.e. nanomaterials and pharmaceutical waste). 

### Organic contaminants 

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are carbon-based toxic compounds that do not break down easily in the 
environment. They remain intact, persisting long enough to bioaccumulate in the fat tissue of humans and 
animals. POPs enter freshwater systems through the discharge of municipal and industrial wastewater, through 
agricultural effluents, and from non-point source contamination.

### Inorganic contaminants

Similarly, inorganic chemicals including heavy metals find their way into freshwater from municipal and industrial 
wastewater, mining operations and urban run-off. Inorganic contaminants (typically arsenic [As], calcium [Ca], 
cadmium [Cd], iron [Fe], mercury [Hg], sodium [Na], lead [Pb] and their compounds) in dangerous concentrations 
can harm or kill aquatic life and make water unfit for municipal or industrial applications. 

### Nanocontamination

Nanocontamination refers to particulate contaminants 1-100 nanometres (nm) in size with special properties 
such as a high surface area to volume ratio. Nanoparticles are a very large and growing class of contaminants 
originating from both natural (e.g. forest fires, volcanic eruptions) and artificial sources. They can be organic 
or inorganic (Naghdi et al. 2017). Like traditional contaminants, nanoparticles are unintentionally released into 
natural water during their production or through a waste stream. Some are considered toxic to freshwater 
ecosystems. For example, silver nanoparticles dissolved in water release silver ions which act as an antibiotic, 
destroying critical bacterial populations, while the photocatalyst nanomaterial titanium dioxide (TiO2) can 
accelerate chemical reactions in water. Naghdi et al. (2017) present an overview of nanoparticles in the natural 
environment and associated measurement techniques.

### Pharmaceutical contamination

Pharmaceutical contamination originates from prescription and over-the-counter medications including 
antibiotics, painkillers and antidepressants. A main pathway into freshwater systems is discharges from 
wastewater treatment plants, which are often inefficient at removing these products. Other pathways include 
direct releases from drug manufacturing, human and animal excretion, uncontrolled disposal of expired or unused 
medicines, animal husbandry and aquaculture (WHO 2012). While observed concentrations of pharmaceuticals 
in drinking water have been reported to be several orders of magnitude below the therapeutic dose (which 
means they likely present a negligible risk to human health), knowledge gaps exist. They include the assessment 
of risks to human health associated with long-term exposure to low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, as well 
as the possible combined effects of pharmaceutical mixtures (WHO 2012). However, many studies have looked 
at the effects of aquatic organisms’ exposure to pharmaceutical contaminants. For example, Aliko et al. (2019) 
report changes in the nervous system of goldfish such as stressed behaviour and hyperactivity.

### Pastics interaction with contaminants
Plastic contamination (macro- to nanoscale) may interact with other freshwater contaminants through 
varying mechanisms. Two general modes are recognized and discussed in this chapter: contaminants as 
residual monomers or additives in plastic (during manufacturing), and as sorbates on plastic waste (usually 
microplastics)

### Contaminants as non-polymerized free monomers

Non-polymerized free monomers are a type of organic contaminant that results from (or is a residue of) plastic 
production. Caused by residual monomers being “trapped” in the bulk material and remaining unpolymerized, 
they are considered possible organic contaminants because their low molecular weight allows them to easily 
mobilize away from the bulk polymer product and transfer to their surroundings. Most concerns about released 
toxic monomers have been related to human exposure via food packaging, particularly vinyl chloride as part of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products and styrene as part of polystyrene products (Hahladakis et al. 2018).

### Additives as plastic contaminants

One type of interaction occurs when the contaminant is already found in virgin plastic as a result of the manufacturing 
process. Although plastic is structurally based on polymer chains, almost all commercial plastics contain some 
amount of non-polymeric ingredients used to impart specific properties such as UV resistance, pliability, hardness 
and colour (Table 9.1). Some of these additives (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs] and mirex) are considered 
toxic and are on the Stockholm Convention’s list of POPs. Note that the Stockholm Convention lists the 12 original 
POPs, POPs which have been added to the list, and POPs recommended for listing (Stockholm Convention 2019).
Plasticizers, often in the form of phthalates, are commonly incorporated in plastics since they increase flexibility 
to prevent shattering, although they are considered dangerous to human and animal development, with the most 
notable effects being those on reproductive health (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Talsness et al. 2009). A study ranking 
the hazard level of different polymers determined one type of PVC polymer to be the fifth most hazardous 
(out of 55) due to its plasticizer additive (Lithner, Larsson and Dave 2011). Similarly, flame retardants such as 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of potentially toxic additives that have been shown to act 
as endocrine disrupters as well as being carcinogenic and neurotoxic (Darnerud 2003; Birnbaum and Staskal 
2004). Other additives (heat stabilizers and slip agents) have been shown to contain trace metals, cadmium, 
zinc and lead (Munier and Bendell 2018).

The fact that potentially toxic compounds already exist within the chemical makeup of the plastic presents 
two pathways for exposure. This first is that as plastic breaks down into microplastics, it is more likely to be 
ingested by organisms and enter the food chain. For example, microplastics were observed in the gills, stomach 
and hepatopancreas of the fiddler crab following two-month exposure to fragments derived from polystyrene 
pellets (Brennecke et al. 2015). Browne et al. (2008) demonstrated experimentally that a species of mussel, 
Mytilus edulis, can ingest different sized plastic fragments that reside in their body (gut and circulatory system) 
for over 48 days. Overall, Gallo et al. (2018) reported that exposure to microplastics via different mechanisms 
has been demonstrated in more than 100 marine species ranging from zooplankton to whales. In the freshwater 
environment, although much less researched than marine species, biological impacts of microplastics have 
been observed in organisms such as zooplankton, crustaceans and mussels (Lambert and Wagner 2018). While 
freshwater invertebrates are considered more vulnerable to microplastics, vertebrate species (e.g. zebrafish and 
African catfish) have experienced considerable interaction risks such as ingestion, dermal uptake and chemical 
impacts (Scherer et al. 2018).

The other exposure route is through leaching of the contaminant from the plastic into the surrounding aquatic 
environment. Although most marine-based studies suggest that the primary threat to human and animal health 
is through actual plastic ingestion, evidence suggests that chemical transfer can occur via dissolved constituents 
in seawater (Hermabessiere et al. 2017). Plastic additives have a low molecular weight (Lithner, Larsson, and 
Dave 2011) and are not chemically bonded to the polymer (Gewert, Plassmann and MacLeod 2015). These 
additives have already been detected in the marine environment as a result of degradation of plastic waste in the 
ocean (Hermabessiere et al. 2017). However, understanding and forecasting the potential hazard of released or 
leached additives is a challenge, as the mechanism is dependent on a number of factors including type of plastic 
and ambient conditions (e.g. temperature, sunlight, oxygen level) (Gewert, Plassmann and MacLeod 2015). In 
the freshwater environment capturing the effects of chemicals leaching from plastic is difficult (Lambert and 
Wagner 2018). Not only is it much less observed compared with the marine environment, but most reported 
studies are performed in the laboratory under exaggerated toxic conditions. For example Lithner, Nordensvan 
and Dave (2012) looked at the effects of leachates from different polymer types on the freshwater species 
Daphnia magna and Bejgarn et al. (2015) examined the effects on the copepod Nitocra spinipes.

A number of studies illustrate the potential for toxic leachates to form from degrading plastic. For example, it 
was found that based on differing simulated weathering intensities/duration of assorted polymers, incidents of 
toxic leachates from a few different polymer types occured (Bejgarn et al. 2015). Another study looked at the 
effect of hydrophobicity (level of water solubility) on the formation of leachates as measured by larval survival 
and settlement of a barnacle species in seawater (Li et al. 2016). It has also been recognized that plastic waste 
in a landfill can produce dangerous leachates that eventually leak into local freshwater sources (Teuten et al. 
2009). One study showed that the toxicity levels of two plastic sacks due to leaching differed based on the 
manufacturers’ ingredients. This demonstrates that a wide diversity of chemicals are used by different plastic 
manufacturers even if the goal is to produce the same polymer (Hamlin, Marciano and Downs 2015). 
Once contaminant compounds migrate and leach from the polymer source into the surrounding medium, they 
have the potential to be taken up by other organisms or adsorb onto other particles, including other available 
plastics.

### Contaminants as adsorbates to plastic

Another mechanism is the adsorption (attachment) of contaminant compounds from the surrounding water 
to the plastic. Adsorption occurs because of the hydrophobicity of certain POPs and toxic metals (e.g. lead, 
cadmium, chromium and copper), which allows contaminants to more easily attract and adhere to other non-
polar materials such as plastics and fatty material. There are a number of published hydrophobic ratings for 
certain plastic additives and organic contaminants in the form of the octanol-water partitioning coefficient 
(log kow), which illustrates the likelihood of certain compounds to adsorb to plastic compared with others. In 
comparison with other surrounding media, hydrophobic compounds can accumulate on plastic debris at greater 
concentrations than in the surrounding water, sediment and suspended particles (Mato et al. 2001; Ogata et al. 
2009, Teuten et al. 2009).

Plastics can adsorb contaminants primarily as a function of the concentration gradient, as it dictates the ease 
at which plastics can adsorb other compounds (Koelmans et al. 2013). Secondary drivers of the sorption of 
chemicals to plastics are not only factors relating to the surrounding aquatic environment such as temperature, 
pH, and salinity (Engler 2012), but also the physical state of the plastic. For example, when plastic undergoes 
weathering and/or degradation, the surface area to volume ratio of the plastic tends to increase, which supports 
an accumulation of dissolved contaminants (Rochman 2013).

As plastics have the potential to adsorb contaminants from their surrounding environment, the contaminant 
could be considered, for the time being, as removed from the system. For example, research by Rochman, 
Hentschel and Teh (2014) found long-term sorption of the metals zinc, cadmium and lead on different polymers 
such as PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE and PP. Similarly, using a weak acid extraction method, Munier and Bendell 
(2018) found that copper and lead were detected as adsorbed metals on sampled plastic debris, primarily PVC 
plastic. Mato et al. (2001) found high concentrations of PCBs adsorbed to plastic pellets in seawater.
Plastics carrying adsorbed contaminants are known to play a role in transferring contaminants to organisms 
or other parts of the environment. For example, in an experiment with the peppery furrow shell clam not only 
did digested microplastics lead to mechanical injury of the gills, but when the microplastics had adsorbed 
contaminants (benzo(a)pyrene [BaP] and perfluorooctane), a negative influence over the assessed biomarkers 
was observed in their tissue (O’Donovan et al. 2018). Similar studies have documented toxicity levels and signs 
of bioaccumulation in marine mussels (Avio et al. 2015), Japanese medaka fish (Rochman 2013), and the 
lugworm Arenicola marina (L.) (Besseling et al. 2013), to name a few, when they were exposed to microplastics 
(such as polystyrene or polyethylene) that had some degree of adsorbed organic contaminants such as PCBs 
or polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

Microplastics have also been shown to interact with inorganic contaminants. For example, it was found 
that because different types of plastics are able to adsorb chromium over time, ingestion of these kinds of 
contaminated microplastics by marine organisms (in this study, the common goby) can induce toxic effects such 
as reduced predatory performance (Luís et al. 2015). Another recent study showed changed bioaccumulation 
rates in European seabass fish species due to exposure to mercury-adsorbed microplastic (Barboza et al. 2018).
It should be noted that the majority of observations documenting the role of microplastics as a contaminant 
carrier to aquatic organisms have been done in the marine ecosystem. Scherer et al. (2018) caution that the 
mechanism is likely to be different in freshwater, where the flux of chemicals (from wastewater streams) is 
relatively continuous, the abiotic conditions are different and the source of plastic contamination is “younger”. 
Moreover, the generally higher concentrations of natural fine particles (turbidity) and of dissolved organic carbon 
in freshwater are likely to influence the interactions between microplastics and contaminants.
The presence of microplastics with other contaminants does not always indicate an increased risk of toxic 
exposure. Scherer et al. (2018) warn against assuming the “vector hypothesis” which characterizes microplastics 
as a simple transporter of waterborne contaminants to aquatic organisms. In reality, adsorption-desorption 
kinetics are much more complicated. Based on a number of factors such as microplastic concentration levels 
and aquatic species, negligible effects of bioaccumulation levels have been observed (Scherer et al. 2018). 
For example, it was found that there was no significant effect from bioaccumulation of bisphenol A (BPA) in 
freshwater zooplankton experimentally exposed to BPA-adsorbed polyamide microparticles (Rehse, Kloas and 
Zarfl 2018).

### Contaminants mixed with plastic

In addition to observing toxicity levels for mixtures of microplastics with expected organic and metal 
contaminants, the influence of microplastics’ interaction with emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals 
and nanocontaminants has been considered. Moreover, it is suspected that the interaction of plastics with other 
contaminants, referred to by Rochman (2013) as a “cocktail of contaminants”, in the aquatic environment may 
lead to effects beyond what would occur as a result of a contaminant alone. In an experimental study by Ferreira 
et al. (2016) despite the common goby fish being exposed to a combination of gold nanoparticles, microplastics 
and temperature increase, observed metal toxicity did not change as a function of microplastics. In another study 
the effects of polyethylene microbeads mixed with triclosan (an antibacterial agent) on the marine copepod 
Acartia tonsa indicated that the microbeads increased the toxicity of triclosan (Syberg et al. 2017). Similarly, a 
study by Prata et al. (2018) found that when the pharmaceuticals procainamide and doxycycline were mixed 
with microplastics, the toxic effect on marine microalgae (as measured by chlorophyll concentrations and 
growth rate) was stronger than the effect of pharmaceuticals alone.

It should be noted that another possible mode of contaminant interaction occurs when plastic contamination, 
in the form of microplastics or nanoplastics, becomes integrated into the particulate or bed load of a 
freshwater system. Microplastics can then serve as carriers of adsorbed contaminants, metals, and pathogenic 
microorganisms and parasites. Microplastics have serious implications with respect to the role of wastewater 
treatment plants, which raises questions about their treatment processes and the quality of the effluent 
using current practices (Mason et al. 2016; Ziajahromi, Neale and Leusch 2016). 

## Summary of recommendations for monitoring plastics in freshwater

### Designing a monitoring programme

Generally, the effort required to monitor plastics, in terms of technical equipment and the training level of staff, 
increases with decreasing particle size. While floating macroplastics can simply be observed from a bridge and 
manually counted, sampling and analysing microplastics requires specialized equipment, access to lab facilities 
and costly instruments such as microscopes and, for example, FTIR spectrometers. Thus, it is recommended 
to design a hierarchal monitoring programme which monitors macroplastics using basic methods.  

Plastic concentrations in freshwater systems such as rivers and lakes/reservoirs can be considered highly 
variable, both in space and time. Hydrologic events may mobilize material from a catchment, resulting in a 
considerable change in the plastic concentration. Temporal variations could be systematic (e.g. increasing 
concentrations with increasing discharge). This systematic behaviour might be used to extrapolate from the 
observed data to periods where only metadata such as river discharge are available. Therefore, fewer monitoring 
locations with frequent measuring intervals can create valuable insights into the behaviour of the observed 
system.
Key recommendations for designing a plastic monitoring programme are: 

1. Build around existing sampling and analysis protocols, as well as classification schemes, to ensure consistent 
data.
2. Integrate plastic monitoring into existing programmes for other substances and make use of available 
metadata such as river discharge.
3. Carry out frequent, long-term observations rather than high spatial variation.
4. Carry out sampling and analysis that can use simpler methods, rather than fewer samples needing advanced 
analysis.

Ideally, monitoring of freshwater plastics should encompass the entire size range from macroplastics to 
micro- and even nanoplastic particles. Although microplastics have attracted far greater societal attention than 
macroplastics, larger items make up a significant portion of plastic contamination in freshwater and the oceans. 
Macroplastics can be easily monitored, e.g. by counting from a bridge (van Emmerik et al. 2019a ; see also 
Chapter 5). They do not require access to laboratories and highly specialized analytical equipment, as is the 
case for microplastics.

It is recommended that monitoring programmes initially start with macroplastics if the analytical infrastructure 
for microplastics is not available or not yet operational. Macroplastic monitoring can be supported by citizen 
science. Similar to litter from beach clean-ups, plastic debris collected from riverbanks and lake shores can be 
weighed, counted and classified using established protocols. 

If microplastics are to be assessed or monitored, it is highly recommended to choose the lower size limit 
(according to widely published protocols) to facilitate comparability of data. More mass-based microplastic data 
are needed in order to establish mass balances for aquatic systems. To understand exposure, microplastics 
monitoring in biota should be accompanied by sampling of the surrounding environmental media.

### Sampling

Overall, sampling procedures involve collecting plastic to analyse composition, polymer type, item type, size 
and mass distribution. In addition, sampling can reveal the plastic concentration at a given point in space and 
time. However, as shown in Chapter 5, techniques to recover plastic debris in freshwater vary based on the type 
of water body type and the matrix of interest (i.e. sediment, biota). Chapter 6 details the sample preparation for 
each of these types. Overall, the most common sampling technique uses nets, where mesh size depends on 
the plastic size of interest. It is cheaper and easier to sample macroplastics than microplastics, which require 
more sophisticated sampling equipment. 

### Analysis

Sample analysis (described in Chapter 7) includes physical characterization, chemical characterization and, 
in some cases,  biological characterization. Distinguishing between plastic and non-plastic particles is easy 
in the case of macroplastics and feasible in that of microplastics > 1 mm. For sorting and identifying small 
plastic particles, the use of hot needles and staining methods is recommended. To identify the polymer type, 
particle-based or mass-based approaches to chemical characterization can be used. Characterization of 
plastic polymers in environmental samples requires comparison with reference databases of known polymers, 
which are available as a freeware product (“(siMPle”). In addition, some alternative analysis techniques include 
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy, combined with an energy-dispersive 
X-ray microanalyser. 

### Additional considerations

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential use of new technologies for advanced macroplastic monitoring. 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used to measure floating macroplastics in rivers and accumulated 
plastics on beaches. Camera-based systems are also increasingly used for plastic monitoring in rivers. Both 
technologies have significant potential for integration with artificial intelligence (AI) analysis tools, which could 
potentially automate plastic monitoring of riverine systems even further (Kylili et al. 2019). The use of space-
borne remote sensing for plastic detection in coastal zones has been explored. Although the temporal and 
spatial frequency of satellite data may still be inefficient, future initiatives could be suitable for plastic monitoring 
in dynamic riverine systems. 

### Sampling after storm or flood events

For the transport of many materials, it has been found that most of the annual load is caused by single events. 
In the case of plastic such data are still scarce, but available research suggests that extreme events may also 
govern total annual riverine plastic transport. In rivers such as the Rhône the Saigon, the Seine and the Tiber it 
has been observed that monthly plastic transport differed by an order of magnitude. In Romania it that plastic 
transport into rivers and lakes was driven mainly by floods. The importance of floods in microplastics transport 
was demonstrated by Hurley et al. (2018), which found a 70 per cent post-flood decrease in microplastic 
concentration in river sediments across several catchments in the United Kingdom. In addition to floods, other 
natural hazards may result in additional plastic mobilization. Several studies have suggested that the 2011 Great 
East Japan Earthquake caused considerable increases in plastic emissions from land into the ocean. Plastics 
found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and in North America were related to this single event (Lebreton et 
al. 2018). The guidelines therefore recommend a wider geographic distribution of plastic sampling following 
extreme events.

### Dams and reservoirs in plastic contamination and assessment

Many rivers worldwide are dammed. Dams and reservoirs are likely to be at least temporary sinks for plastic of 
various sizes. Evidence suggests that microplastic concentrations in the water column in a reservoir decrease 
while respective concentrations in the sediment increase. However, data to support this relationship are sparse 
to date. It is recommended to include (rather than purposely avoiding) dams when planning river or catchment 
monitoring programmes. If reservoirs have pre-dams, plastic sampling should be focused there. If pre-dams are 
dredged, an analysis of plastic content is recommended along with other sediment analyses.  
Some freshwater reservoirs are used for drinking water abstraction. According to the current state of knowledge, 
drinking water from various sources contains very few small plastic particles and there is no scientific evidence 
that drinking water safety is threatened by plastics. If particle loads in drinking water are assessed, extreme 
care has to be taken to avoid contamination, thus creating a “false alarm”, as very large volumes of water are 
processed and the relevant particles are so small that they can easily be transported through the air.  

### Plastics in the context of other forms of contamination

Some contaminants are associated with the production and use of plastics. Some may be found in plastic-rich 
aquatic systems because they have a common source: waste, wastewater, or other results of human activities. 
The contaminants will be distributed according to the susceptibility/partitioning behaviour and availability of 
the plastic and of other environmental media. In monitoring, priority should be given to the media to which 
humans and freshwater biota are exposed, namely water and sediments. However, from a scientific perspective 
studies are needed to elucidate the possible gender-differentiated effects or non-effects of plastic-associated 
contamination in natural populations.

Regarding risk assessment, the effects of mixtures need to be considered, as well as particle-based versus 
mass-based perspectives. Current knowledge, largely based on estimates, suggests that the ecotoxicological 
risk of microplastics is low and not widespread, but is not zero (Adam, Yang and Nowack 2019; Backhaus and 
Wagner 2019), which may change with increasing plastic contamination in many parts of the world.  

### Data management and availability

Ongoing efforts to harmonize sampling and analytical protocols will improve the comparability of collected 
monitoring data. To minimize barriers to data exchange, the format of data and metadata should be compatible 
with national or international database structures. In particular, the global water quality database GEMStat 
(https://gemstat.org) can serve as an example. It should be noted that plastic is currently not in the GEMStat 
parameter list, although its inclusion is under consideration.

### Metadata

Especially in rivers and lakes, many environmental factors influence plastic concentrations at the time of 
sampling. For data interpretation it is essential to provide not only the locations and timing of sampling, but also 
data on ambient environmental conditions which might influence the observed concentrations such as:

1. time and duration of the sampling (e.g. visual counting);
2. geographic location of the sampling site;
3. precipitation during and prior to the sampling;
4. wind direction during and before the sampling exercise;
5. discharge during and prior to sampling (rivers).

### Units
Often concentrations of plastic are reported as items per volume. If possible, it is recommended to report both 
item counts and mass. In the case of rivers (e.g. when items are visually counted from bridges) it may not be 
possible to report concentrations. The use of the International System of Units (SI) is highly recommended.

###	 Policy recommendations for intervention and prevention

To go from data to action, there is a need to formulate, implement and evaluate relevant intervention and 
prevention policies. Intervention policies refers here to policies meant to reduce existing plastic concentrations 
in freshwater, whereas prevention policies are intended to prevent the input of plastics to the environment. 
While both intervention and prevention policies are of interest in countries, their priority and design will differ 
immensely depending on local conditions such as existing plastic contamination, current waste management 
systems, and local stakeholders’ interest in addressing plastic contamination of freshwater. 

### Policy

In all cases policymaking, implementation and evaluation for reducing plastics in freshwater are challenging and 
call for specific policy approaches. The challenges are generally associated with conflicts, system complexity 
and uncertainty (Kirschke et al. 2017).

### Conflicts

Conflicts typically exist between different stakeholder groups (e.g. environmental interest groups, 
industries and consumers). Such conflicts reflect different priorities, such as the use of plastics in production 
vs. the reduction of plastic consumption. Even if the goal of plastic reduction is shared by different types of 
stakeholders, there are still different ideas about the best ways to reduce plastics in the environment. For 
example, while some argue for better management of plastic waste, others prefer to prohibit the use of plastics 
in industrial production processes.


### Complexity
System complexity pertains to a large number of dynamic and interconnected factors that 
influence the successful design and implementation of intervention and prevention measures. These factors 
are often ascribed to different facets of the social-ecological system, including different stakeholder interests, 
governance conditions, industrial production schemes, natural conditions and technological developments. 
Their management is often challenging, given the abundance of sub-factors, unclear developments, and strong 
positive and negative interactions.

### Uncertainty

Uncertainty challenges policy formulation, implementation and evaluation. While these guidelines 
are a starting point for gathering and analysing data in different contexts, data uncertainty will remain in view of 
public authorities’ generally limited resources for water quality monitoring. Human dimensions provide additional 
uncertainty, for example about the effects of prevention and intervention measures on human behaviour. 
To address these challenges, governance research recommends that policymakers consider a wide range of 
activities (e.g. Kirschke and Newig 2017; Mathews and Stretz 2019). They include the following:
Capacities of public authorities: It is highly recommended to provide responsible public authorities with appropriate 
resources for planning and implementation. Planning under complex conditions can only be successful with 
the necessary human and financial resources. Such resources are needed in order to organize stakeholder 
dialogues, model system complexities, and gather data and knowledge. Policy implementation also requires 
funding (e.g. to control compliance or for economic instruments).

Diversity of stakeholders: Public authorities should involve a broad range of stakeholders in addressing the 
problem. In terms of monitoring, citizen science is an acknowledged way to increase both scientific data 
and knowledge and awareness on the side of citizens (San Llorente Capdevila et al. 2020). Additionally, it is 
recommended that specific measures are put in place to ensure the equal participation of women and their 
organizations, as well as gender experts in stakeholder engagements. This is in line with UNEP’s Resolution 
4/17 which calls for “Promoting gender equality and the human rights and empowerment of women and girls 
in environmental governance”.

Integrated nexus thinking: In planning prevention and intervention policies, responsible public authorities should 
be guided by integrated nexus thinking. Nexus thinking typically calls for involving different sectors in the 
planning process. In the case of plastic contamination, involving the water and waste management sectors 
is particularly important. However, other sectors (e.g. agricultural and industrial) are also relevant. Different 
sectors are typically represented by different public authorities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
private companies. Their involvement is crucial to mediate conflicts between stakeholders, understand system 
complexity and reduce uncertainty.

Diversity of governance instruments: The use of diverse governance instruments to address complex problems 
is emphasized. Such instruments are typically structured as rules and regulations (“sticks”), information 
and cooperation (“sermon”), and economic incentives (“carrots”). Whereas all these policy implementation 
instruments have their place, they are not necessarily used in all countries. In particular, economic incentives are 
typically neglected compared with regulations and information campaigns. Countries may consider discussing 
more openly and creatively which combinations of instruments have the greatest relevance in a given context.
