# Macroplastics in Lakes: An Underrepresented Ecological Problem?

## Introduction
Freshwaters provide essential ecosystem services for human well-being [1]. However,
these ecosystems are largely threatened by various stressors, such as climate change, inva-
sion by alien species, and chemical contamination, which cumulatively cause biodiversity
loss [2]. Among these emerging contaminants, plastics widely affect biota and ecosystem
services [3–5].

In particular, it is known that macroplastics (MAs; plastics > 5 mm, sensu Gallitelli
and Scalici [6]) have a negative impact on aquatic wildlife, for instance, organisms can be
entangled or suffocated, their ingestion can cause the occlusion of the gastrointestinal tract,
and plastic ﬁshing nets can cause the phenomenon of ghost ﬁshing [7,8]. In addition, as
MAs are degraded by abiotic factors [9] and biotic factors [10,11], they can originate from
smaller particles called microplastics (MPs; 10−3 mm < plastics < 5 mm) and nanoplastics
(plastics < 1 µm). Micro- and nano-plastics showed several ecotoxicological and detri-
mental effects on aquatic wildlife [12]. In brief, investigations carried out in the natural
environment showed that organisms are widely exposed and impacted by MPs (see [5,13]).
Conversely, environmental studies on nanoplastics still do not thoroughly explain their
sources, dispersion, and impacts [14].

In the last two decades, the scientiﬁc literature addressing the issue of plastic con-
tamination in freshwater ecosystems has focused especially on MPs rather than MAs [6].
However, it is pivotal to understand the accumulation and distribution of MAs as they
affect freshwater ecosystems per se [15], as well as because they are a source of micro- and
nano-plastics [16]. Although research on freshwater MAs was neglected in the past, the
scientiﬁc interest has recently increased [17]. The studies published on MAs in fresh waters
focus more on investigating the contamination of rivers than the one of lakes. Rivers were
mostly studied in regard to MA transport [6,18,19], possibly due to ﬁnding the pathway
and fate of land-based plastics to the sea, facing the accumulation into the plastic garbage
patch [20,21]. In fact, rivers can be considered the largest vectors of plastics to the seas [22].
The different riverine zones along the entire river rod participate actively as highways
transporting plastics to the sea [6,23].

Considering that lakes are large reservoirs of fresh water and provide many ecosystem
services (e.g., water supply, irrigation), it is important to monitor the threats that may
affect the health status of communities inhabiting the lake, ecosystem functionality, and
water quality. Research on plastic pollution in lakes mainly focuses on MPs, describing the
wide occurrence and abundance of MPs in biota, water, and sediment of lakes worldwide
including remote regions [24], and recently, studies are shedding light on the settling
process of MPs in sediment [25–28]. As MAs are sources of MPs, they are supposed to
widely contaminate lakes as well as MPs. However, the detailed process describing the
contribution of lacustrine MAs to the contamination of lakes by MPs is not clear yet. Even
without considering the link to MP pollution, the scientiﬁc literature poorly describes
qualitatively and quantitatively MA ecological impacts as an independent ﬁeld of research.
Indeed, the detrimental effects of MAs on ecosystems could be further investigated.
The current scientiﬁc context shows limited and fragmented information on lacustrine
MAs. To clarify the starting point of research on the MA pollution of lakes, we provide
the ﬁrst global review of scientiﬁc literature. In particular, this work (i) evaluates the
scientiﬁc productivity by bibliometric data; (ii) provides the scientiﬁc community with an
up-to-date global overview by study area, investigated matrix (water, sediment, biota),
polymer, category of litter, shape; (iii) provides insights towards a standardisation of the
methodology. As outputs, the scientiﬁc interest on lacustrine MAs is evaluated, the focal
points of research and knowledge gaps are highlighted. The contamination scenario is
described by the above parameters to identify the common grounds and main issues that
should be addressed.

## Materials and Methods

This review follows the PRISMA guidelines of systematic reviews [29]. The biblio-
graphic search was carried out by Web of Science and Scopus search engines, which make
it possible to search scientiﬁc material based on various criteria, including time interval
and keywords. The time interval considered for this review starts from a non-ﬁxed start
date to include all available scientiﬁc publications from the past, until 16 October 2022.
The keywords used to select the scientiﬁc material on the topic of interest of this review
were “macroplastic* and lake*”, “macroplastic* and lacustrine”, “macroplastic* and lentic”,
“macroplastic* and freshwater”, “mesoplastic* and lake*”, “mesoplastic* and lacustrine”,
“mesoplastic* and lentic”, and “mesoplastic* and freshwater”. The bibliographic search
also included the term “mesoplastic” because the size range of MAs is not standardised;
hence, for some authors, the smallest size range of MAs are called mesoplastics (i.e., 5 mm
< plastics < 25 mm; see Gallitelli and Scalici [6] and Lippiatt et al. [30]). Only peer-reviewed
scientiﬁc articles were selected. Duplicate articles were eliminated by a preliminary screen-
ing based on the title of articles. Not pertinent articles were excluded after verifying
abstracts. The entire manuscript content of the remaining articles was carefully checked for
suitability as a ﬁnal step. Thereafter, the list of results was obtained.

The articles collected from the bibliographic search were analysed in terms of (1)
bibliometric information, (2) experimental information. The bibliometric information
details the publication temporal trends and the rank of most frequent journals publishing
on this topic. For each article, the bibliometric parameter collected for calculating the
publication temporal trends is the year of publication, while the name of the journal is
noted to evaluate the frequency of occurrence.
The experimental information collected from each article was MA class size deﬁni-
tion, study area characterisation (continent, lake origin, e.g., volcanic, glacial, etc.), the
investigated matrix (e.g., water, sediment, biota), MA shape (i.e., fragment, ﬁbre, bead), the
category of litter (e.g., bottle, ﬁshing net), main plastic polymers detected, and the ratio
between the length of the transects sampled and the lake shoreline total length. For the
length of the lake shoreline, the values were initially searched for in the scientiﬁc literature,
but if not found, the shoreline length was extrapolated by Google Earth measurements

## Results

### Bibliometric Analysis
Overall, 94 publications were collected by Web of Science and 92 by Scopus. After
duplicates were removed, 63 publications remained, including articles or reviews or cor-
respondence or book chapters. We only selected original articles, which were 46. The
screening of abstracts selected 23 articles (Figure S2). Fourteen articles are the result of the
bibliographic search (Table 1). Although the articles have a non-standardised method as
well as a lack of information in some articles compared to others, hindering the comparison,
for the purpose of this review all articles were included. The information of the differences
between the outputs provided by the articles is itself indeed a highlight of this review.
The scientiﬁc literature researching the contamination of lakes by MAs has been
increasing sharply in recent years (Figure 1), suggesting that this topic will draw further
attention in the future. The graph shows a slightly slower growth between 2020 and 2021,
possibly due to the COVID outbreak. The journal with the highest number of articles is
Science of the Total Environment. However, as the number of published articles per
journal ranges from 1 to 3, no journal stands out among the others.

### Macroplastic Size Deﬁnition

The information provided in Table 1 on the deﬁnition of the size range of MAs
shows that there is an evident lack of standardisation. For this reason, the values on
the abundance of MAs are not compared between different articles as the results could be
misleading. There is no prevalent trend to the deﬁnition of size classes in the reviewed
articles. Six studies describe MAs as plastic items >25 mm, ﬁve articles afﬁrm that they
are larger than 5 mm, one article describes MAs as plastic items larger than 20 mm, and
two articles do not report the size (Table 1). The more frequent size classes are >25 mm
and >5 mm. The lack of standardisation on the size of MAs in fresh waters has been
discussed [6]. After reviewing the scientiﬁc literature, Gallitelli and Scalici [6] proposed
to use the size class of >5 mm for the analysis of MAs in rivers, as widely used among
authors investigating MAs in rivers [31–36]. Using the same size classiﬁcation for lacustrine
MAs would allow for a comparison of results between different freshwater ecosystems.
Additionally, using the class size >5 mm will make it possible to include the mesoplastics
into the MAs, thus removing the class “mesoplastics”. It would be useful as the utilisation
of “mesoplastic” is marginal in the scientiﬁc literature compared to MPs and MAs, and
it does not seem that they have unique characteristics which make them substantially
different from macroplastics. Hence, the proposed size class of MAs in lakes shall be > 5 mm.

### Sampled Lakes Description

A few lakes are investigated, i.e., 21, and they are unevenly distributed worldwide.
Isolated reports of contamination are available from all continents: Europe is the
most investigated (occurrence 33%), followed by North America (24%). Africa and Asia are
equally investigated (19%), while South America is the least investigated (5%) (Figure 4a).

The origin of the lakes could be a relevant parameter to provide indirect information
on the abundance and distribution of MAs, for instance, due to different characteristics
of shorelines and the effects of dams (for anthropogenic lakes), although it has not been
evaluated yet. As data on the origin of lakes could be exploited in the future, this review
includes them in the results. Both natural and anthropogenic lakes are investigated by
current scientiﬁc literature on this topic. The highest number of sampled lakes has glacial
origin (38%), glacial origin (38%), not reported (24%), reservoir (19%), anthropogenic
(10%), ﬂoodplain and tectonic (both 5%) (Figure 4b). The listed group of glacial lakes is
mostly comprised by the American Great Lakes [37]. Each of the American Great Lakes
is considered singularly for this metric. There is a lack of information on several types of
lakes which is surely connected to the low number of articles available on this topic.

### Shape of Sampled Macroplastics

Five articles examine the shape of the items collected, ﬁnding that ﬁbres are the most
frequent shape. However, in addition to shape, the MA items can also be described in dif-
ferent categories according to their use. The top-three categories described in different lakes
are: bags, bottles, beverage bottles, bottle caps, cellophane bags, ﬁshing lines, food wrap-
pers, packaging material, plastic canisters, plastic plates, and synthetic clothes (Figure 5).
The categories are not standardised across the articles. To allow for the comparison, the
categories are renamed by classifying them according to the United Nations Environment
Programme/Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNEP/IOC) Guidelines on
Survey and Monitoring of Marine Litter [38] (Table S1). This new dataset shows that there
is no category signiﬁcantly more abundant than the others if the number of items if consid-
ered, while plastic bottles are the main contaminant if mass (g) is evaluated. However, this
result is based on a limited amount of information from the scientiﬁc literature so it cannot
be generalised.
 
### Main Polymers of Sampled Macroplastics

Four articles examine the type of polymer of MAs in seven lakes. It is shown that
polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) are the most frequent polymers among the top-
three ranking polymers (Figure 6). In detail, PP is described in all articles examining the
chemical composition of the MAs, while PS in three of four articles, and the other polymers
in only one article each. The lower abundance of PE is in contrast with the study of Gallitelli
and Scalici [6], which reviews the contamination by MAs in rivers and assesses that HDPE
and LDPE are the main contaminants with PP and PS being below 10% of occurrence each.
This could be due to the different habitat sampled or by the smallest dataset available
on lakes. Conversely, the result of this study is partially in agreement with the results
reviewed on microplastics contaminating freshwater ecosystems [13], which show that
the main microplastic polymers found in water and sediment are PP and PE (more than
50% of occurrence). The presence of a certain MA polymer could explain the presence of
microplastics of the same polymer type that generated the fragmentation of MAs. The
relationship between the plastic items of these two class sizes is to be taken into account in
future investigations of lake contamination.

### On the Transect Length—Shoreline Length Ratio

Data on the shoreline length could be obtained from all 21 lakes, while the values of
transect length could be collected from 16 lakes (Table S2). The median transect length is
440 m and the minimum length is 40 m, while the maximum one is 950 m. The length of
transects is signiﬁcantly lower than the shoreline length (Kolmogorov–Smirnov, p < 0.01).
Only 0.12% of the shoreline is sampled (median value) with the minimum sampled transect
being 0.0006% of the total shoreline and the maximum being 100% of the whole shoreline.
These ﬁgures call into question the representativity of results if generalised over the entire
lake. There are no guidelines assessing the minimum shoreline to be sampled to have
a precise and accurate assessment of lake contamination by Mas, nor on how to choose
the sampling stations, i.e., which beaches to sample. Additionally, it should be taken into
account that the sampling efforts required to sample along the shoreline are greater in
larger lakes than in smaller lakes to maintain a high ratio transect length—shoreline length.

## Methodological Discussion

### How to Select the Sampling Stations on Lake Shorelines

There is not a standardised protocol to select the sampling stations. Arturo and Corco-
ran [37] select the stations “according to public accessibility while trying to keep the spacing
between each location as regular as possible”. Accessibility is also a parameter taken into
account by Merga et al. [39]. Most articles take into consideration the anthropogenic pres-
sures for choosing the sampling stations: high and low population density [40–42]; type of
anthropogenic activity [39,41,43–45]. Topography and exposition are also parameters taken
into consideration [41,43,44].

In order to create some standardisation on shoreline sampling, the methodologies
adopted by the scientiﬁc literature on sampling marine ecosystems is discussed for appli-
cations in lake shorelines. In particular, the Guidelines for Monitoring Marine Litter on
the Beaches in the OSPAR Maritime Area (OSPAR guidelines) and the Guidelines for the
Monitoring and Assessment of Plastic Litter in the Ocean by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA guidelines) are among the most cited ones to describe
methodological protocols to monitor litter on marine beaches [30,46]. They are used as
reference to evaluate whether the consolidated methodology on macroplastics in beaches
can be applied for lake shorelines as well. In order to decide how to select the sampling
stations, OSPAR and NOAA suggest dividing the coast in sectors, each representative of a
marine area. The same reasoning could be applied to lakes, i.e., to divide the lake shoreline
in sectors according to topography and exposition. As an example, considering the simplest
case study, i.e., a circular shoreline of a volcanic lake, at least four sectors should be chosen,
one at each cardinal point to detect the effects of wind and currents. However, the knowl-
edge of the local lake chosen as study area by the authors is a requisite in order to divide
the lake in representative sectors. As the identiﬁcation of lake sectors is a relevant factor
to choose the sampling sites and interpret the results, it is recommended to be thoroughly
explained in the methodological section. As an additional variable, the division in sectors
is scale-dependent: coves or inlets can be considered singularly or cumulatively at different
scales. The relevance of the scale at which the investigation should be carried out is to be
evaluated by further research.
Thereafter, based on the scientiﬁc literature outputs, we suggest two methodological
steps for selecting the stations: (1) within each sector, perspective stations shall be chosen
according to their accessibility; (2) among the stations chosen in step 1, it is auspicated that
the perspective stations shall be representative of all anthropogenic pressures impacting
that lake sector as well as areas supposed to be pristine. To evaluate the pressures impacting
the lake sector, the land use could be observed, the presence of tributaries, and a local survey
could identify local types of anthropogenic activities impacting the perspective stations.
A reasonable minimum of one station for each sector is recommended to be sampled to
provide an overview of the variability of contamination across the lake shoreline sectors.

### Sampling Unit Methodology

There is no homogeneity in the methodology to sample the shoreline stations, and
some authors do not describe their applied methodology in detail [47–49]. The use of
transects is prevalent but they can be set either parallel to the shoreline or perpendicular
to the shoreline [44,45], and there can be one transect [37,50] or more transects (usually
three) [40,42–44]. Additionally, some authors sample along all transects [36,44,48,49], while
others sample quadrat plots along that line [40,42–44]. About half of the articles do not
provide references to support their sampling methodology [37,39,41,47–49,51]. Among
the ones that do refer to previous work, the references used are Fisher et al. [44,52], Heo
et al. [43,53], Hidalgo-Ruz et al. [43,54], Loder and Gerdts [43,55], NOAA guidelines,
i.e., Lippiatt et al. [30,40,50], and OSPAR guidelines [45,46,56]. The NOAA and OSPAR
guidelines are the most used methods as they are repeated by two papers each. These
few repetitions hardly provide sufﬁcient strength to recommend the NOAA or OSPAR
sampling methods. A study comparing these methods is not available; hence, it is not
possible to identify the most appropriate one to date.
As there is no scientiﬁc consensus, our suggestion is to follow the UNEP/IOC guide-
lines [38], where the authors describe that the length of the transect is not ﬁxed strictly but
should be appropriate to the amount of litter contaminating the beach to provide reliable
data, i.e., poorly contaminated beaches shall have a higher sampling effort. The minimum
sampled transect should be 100 m while the maximum length is usually 1000 m, or even
multiples of 1000 m in almost pristine beaches [38]. The sampling should cover from the
water edge to the back of beach, deﬁned by vegetation [38]. The items are described in
categories according to UNEP/IOC guidelines.
We highlight a recent publication describing guidelines for the monitoring of plastics
in freshwater ecosystems: “Monitoring Plastics in Rivers and Lakes: Guidelines for the
Harmonization of Methodologies” by the United Nations Environmental Programme
(UNEP) [57]. It includes a proposal of sampling methodologies of plastics in lakes, including
both water, sediment, and shoreline. The application of the described methods for lacustrine
MAs could be tested to provide support for further investigations in lakes.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The outputs of this review aim at representing a contribution to researching a widespread
contaminant affecting lentic ecosystems worldwide, yet which is still poorly investigated, by
critically discussing the knowledge gaps and providing future perspectives. It will hopefully
be useful as a starting point to researchers approaching lacustrine MAs for the first time as
well as an opportunity for experienced researchers to contextualise their research in a global
scenario.
In detail, this overview shows that lakes are polluted in different geographical areas
with various levels of contamination. In particular, the single-use plastic is the main
lacustrine MA category polluting the shoreline. It is noticed how the contamination
of nearshore is the focus of research. Conversely, the ﬂoating lacustrine MAs and the
entrapment by vegetation are scarcely investigated. However, a lack of methodological
standardisation is also highlighted.
Research on the impacts of lacustrine MAs has been neglected until recent years, but
given the growing interest on this topic of research, the sampling effort is desirable to
increase in the futures to provide a clearer overview and quantiﬁcation of the impact of
lacustrine MA pollution. In detail, we suggest focusing the research efforts on identifying
the factors positively relating with the abundance and spatiotemporal variability of MAs
and quantifying their contribution; describe the dispersal process and identify the sinks
(including the role of vegetation to MA entrapment); evaluate the characteristics of bio-
fouling (e.g., taxa, ecological succession) and impacts on organisms (e.g., entrapment). We
also suggest disseminating information on the detected abundance and litter categories of
lacustrine MAs to raise public awareness in order to protect the lake ecosystem. However,
above all possible ﬁelds of research on lacustrine MAs, we strongly suggest prioritising
a methodological, thorough investigation to avoid issues on the comparability of results,
which often characterise research on plastics. Based on the results of this review, the follow-
ing recommendations are provided as an output to contribute to increase standardisation
and promote a scientiﬁc discussion on this topic:

* Use “>5 mm” as class deﬁnition for MA items;
* Standardise the sampling methodology to UNEP/IOC guidelines;
* Standardise the deﬁnition of plastic litter categories according to UNEP/IOC guide-
lines;
* Chemically identify the plastic items to evaluate the main polymers.

Due to the several knowledge gaps of the scientiﬁc literature, this review can limitedly
deﬁne the impacts of lacustrine MAs but aims to strongly support and enhance the scientiﬁc
debate. The results here provided are the ﬁrst to focalise the scientiﬁc community on MAs
in lakes. In the future, the issue of lacustrine MAs will hopefully be addressed in the optic
to evaluate their abundance, dispersal in the biogeological cycle, and impacts, in order to
limit their introduction into the lacustrine environment, mitigate the contamination, and
eventually restore the ecosystems.
