# Using nature preserve creek cleanups to quantify anthropogenic litter accumulation in an urban watershed

## Abstract:

Urban watersheds collect anthropogenic litter from populous areas and carry it through creeks and rivers to downstream ecosystems. 
Aquatic litter pollution has increasingly been addressed with the help of public engagement. 
Community science with amateur (citizen) scientist participation has focused on the assessment and reme- diation of plastic 
litter pollution through monitoring or cleanups. However, community science and more analyt- ical research approaches have 
rarely been combined in upstream urban habitats where anthropogenic litter often originates. In freshwater streams, litter 
may be retained by natural and constructed obstructions, including beaver dams or restoration structures designed to mimic 
natural dams, but such retention has not yet been studied. Through community science cleanups, this study investigated the 
sources, material composition, functions, accu- mulation rates, and temporal and spatial distribution of litter in Mill 
Creek in the Blue Heron Nature Preserve, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. In 6 ∼monthly cleanups, we removed, counted, and categorized
14,520 pieces of litter. Poly- styrene was the most frequently collected material type (56.4%). Fragments that could not be 
functionally classi- ﬁed were the most abundant functional category (70.8%). Of the items that could be categorized by 
function, single- use plastics, such as food and beverage packaging, were most numerous. Presence of stream infrastructure, 
including beaver dam analogues (BDAs), increased the retention of total litter and most litter material types, but these 
effects often varied with time. BDAs affected litter capture patterns directly, as a barrier catching debris in the water column 
and ﬂoating on the water surface, and indirectly, by diverting ﬂood waters over the banks and depositing litter into the ﬂoodplain. 
There were no consistent effects of rain-event magnitude, frequency, or total rain between cleanups on litter-accumulation rates. 
The dynamic temporal interactions of rain and litter are complex, but the functional types and spatial distribution of litter 
suggest that most litter was carried indirectly from consumers in the commercial, residential, and public roadway areas within 
the watershed. This study showed that community cleanup efforts can be coupled with quantitative and qualitative data collection. 
This multifaceted approach can help address anthro- pogenic litter problems, create opportunities for engagement and outreach, 
and contribute valuable information to ongoing community and scientiﬁc dialogs.

Every year, over 10 million tons of plastic debris enters the world’s oceans (Almroth and Eggert 2019). Most marine debris 
is thought to originate on land (Jambeck et al. 2015, Lebreton et al. 2017, van Emmerik and Schwarz 2020) and then be transported 
to oceans by freshwater systems, such as rivers (McCormick and Hoellein 2016, Schmidt et al. 2017, Winton et al. 2020). However, 
there are still discrepancies between the rate at which rivers carry plastic toward the ocean and the observed quantity of 
marine plastic debris. This missing plastic problem (Schmidt et al. 2017, Owens and Kamil 2020) appears to be a function of our 
relative lack of understanding of freshwater litter residency time (Cable et al. 2017) and its accumulation rates 
(Jambeck et al. 2015, Winton et al. 2020). The discrepancies may be resolved by studying freshwater envi-ronments that dynamically 
accumulate plastic debris (Owens and Kamil 2020, Winton et al. 2020, Hoellein and Rochman 2021). The presence of litter in freshwater 
environments has been correlated to the proximity of storm-water drain out- lets, public roads (Willis et al. 2017), and urban populations 
(Rech et al. 2015, Lebreton et al. 2017). Urbanization removes natural vegetation barricades and creates an impervious landscape for precipitation. 
This inability to absorb rainfall generates high runoff volumes and power in local creeks and rivers during storm events, 
leading to degradation symptoms of a condition termed urban stream syndrome (Walsh et al. 2005, Booth et al. 2016). Anthropo- genic litter and 
pollutants deposited on impervious surfaces are easily transported by runoff to streams and rivers within the watershed 
(Barbosa et al. 2012, Rech et al. 2015) via storm drains (Walsh et al. 2005, Blettler et al. 2018). The high var- iability 
between base ﬂow and storm ﬂow can compromise stream hydromorphic properties, subsequently increasing ﬂood risk and erosion 
(Bernhardt and Palmer 2007, Barbosa et al. 2012).

Urban stream restoration has been approached in vari- ous ways to re-establish stream ecology and morphology altered by 
urbanization (Bernhardt and Palmer 2007). Methods of restoration, which can include replacing ripar- ian vegetation and 
manipulating water trajectories to re- conﬁgure stream morphology, may incidentally capture anthropogenic pollution (Charbonneau and Resh 1992). 
Emerging technologies, such as artisanal boom barriers and drainage nets, have also been implemented explicitly for freshwater
litter capture (Blettler and Wantzen 2019). For example, the city of Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and its part- ners tested 2 different 
freshwater litter trap techniques in Atlanta’s Proctor Creek in 2019 to 2020 (Wiener and White 2020). These techniques included 
ﬂoating boom and submerged aluminum traps, which collected a combined total of >450 kg of trash during the study period.

Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) offer a method of stream restoration by reducing ﬂow rates of urban runoff and diverting ﬂow into ﬂoodplains. 
They are artiﬁcially constructed, temporary structures that fulﬁll the functional role of natural beaver dams. They obstruct water 
ﬂow and accelerate sedi- ment accumulation while remaining semi-porous and allow- ing the movement of aquatic animals (Pollock et al. 2014). 
Reducing stream ﬂow limits the water’s power and turbu- lence, disperses a water body across a wider area, and poten- tially reduces the 
impact of runoff on erosion and ﬂooding. BDAs prompt a stream’s hydromorphology to re-adjust to a more natural state as a complex
ﬂoodplain (Pollock et al. 2017). They also potentially function as barriers to ﬂoating debris and may act as sites of litter accrual; 
however, studies in this area are lacking (e.g., Ecke et al. 2017).

Freshwater litter assessments are typically sampling or accumulation based. In sampling studies, litter composition is observed
in a representative area and extrapolated to a larger scale (Rech et al. 2015, Kiessling et al. 2019, Owens and Kamil 2020). 
In these studies, litter may be removed from the study area or left behind after data have been collected. This method offers 
efﬁciency in obtaining the data necessary for scientiﬁc study and allows large areas to be in- cluded through extrapolation of 
sample results (Owens and Kamil 2020). However, because litter is not removed from most of the study area, these studies do 
not contribute to remediation of litter prevalence. In contrast, accumulation studies incorporate cleanup methods that include removing 
all debris from the study region over repeated intervals. This method can reduce litter in the short term (Vincent and Hoellein 2017), 
and it offers an aspect of community service and public education that is difﬁcult to attain via sampling (Rech et al. 2015, Owens and Kamil 2020). 
Additionally, with repeated cleanups in the same study area, net litter- accumulation rates can be established by observing 
the litter accumulated between cleanup events.

Cleanup activities, however, have historically lacked structured scientiﬁc methodology (Cowger et al. 2019, van Emmerik and Schwarz 2020). 
These efforts, therefore, are typ- ically missing quantiﬁcation and categorization components, and there are few studies that 
demonstrate the combina- tion of community cleanup with scientiﬁc analysis. However, this combined approach shows great promise 
for engaging the public while increasing data quantity and sampling ef- fort in a research area that covers immense environmental 
and scientiﬁc problems (Hoellein et al. 2015, Barrows et al. 2018).

Litter quantiﬁcation combined with composition analysis can be used to establish the distributions of various materials 
and functions of litter found in a given area. Lit- ter can be quantiﬁed by count (Willis et al. 2017), mass (Vincent and Hoellein 2017), 
or density (Hoellein et al. 2014, Rech et al. 2015, Vincent and Hoellein 2017, Kiessling et al. 2019). Regardless of the 
quantiﬁcation method, relative per- centages are typically used to deduce the primary material and functional contributors, 
which can then be used to un- derstand and mitigate the litter sources (Lebreton et al. 2017, Hoellein and Rochman 2021).

Litter source identiﬁcation is important for informing litter management and mitigation strategies (Kiessling et al. 2019). 
For example, the presence of certain sanitary items can indicate issues with sewage overﬂow (Bruge et al. 2018). 
Litter sources can be identiﬁed by examining the spatial dis- tribution of litter, which varies between sampling sites 
(Vin- cent et al. 2017) and can be assessed with counts or masses when comparing equivalent areas. Determining the 
sources of litter relies on an understanding of the surveyed area and nearby infrastructure. For example, shores that 
are closer to roads and easier to access experience higher visitor vol- umes and are correlated with increased litter 
levels (Mc- Cormick and Hoellein 2016, Willis et al. 2017, Kiessling et al. 2019). High litter concentrations near illegal 
dumping sites indicate illegal dumping as the likely source (Rech et al. 2015). Nearby manufacturing facilities can implicate 
industrial sources, such as if plastic preproduction pellets were found near a plastic manufacturer (Tramoy et al. 2019). 
Inversely, the absence of those facilities can eliminate their possibility as a source (Vincent and Hoellein 2017).

Litter can be classiﬁed by material, function, or purpose (McCormick and Hoellein 2016), and these classiﬁcations can 
also provide information on the likely (van Calcar and van Emmerik et al. 2019) or unlikely sources of the litter. 
For instance, food-related packaging may be evidence of onsite consumption and discard (Hoellein et al. 2014), and 
accumulation of single-use household waste is a reasonable indication that larger-scale sources, such as manufacturing or 
commercial ﬁshing, are not the culprit (Owens and Kamil 2020). The level of weathering of a piece of litter can be used to 
infer its age and likelihood of travel via wind or rain (Vincent and Hoellein 2017).

This study aimed to characterize accumulation rates, composition, spatial and temporal distribution, and potential sources 
of litter in an urban creek. We sought to com- bine the ecological and community-service beneﬁts of creek cleanups with 
standardized methods of quantitative ripar- ian litter-collection studies (Owens and Kamil 2020) and identify options for 
litter management in the area. We also investigated the effects of BDA presence in an urban water- shed, including effects 
on litter accumulation and stream morphology. Further, we expected litter was brought to the creek by runoff from the 
encompassing watershed area and, therefore, predicted a correlation between litter accumulation and precipitation events.

## Methods

To address our study objectives, we completed a creek cleanup accumulation study. We used citizen science methods to 
leverage stream-litter-cleanup efforts and collect data about litter during 6 data-collection events over a 6-mo period. 
We collected data on litter-accumulation rate, type, and distribution, and we used repeated measures multivariate analysis 
to compare these variables over time and be- fore/after BDA installation. We also computed correlations for litter totals
and accumulation rates with rainfall param- eters to assess our expectation that precipitation events would be associated
with litter accumulation.

### Study design

Starting in April 2020, groups of 4 to 8 people completed 6 ∼monthly litter cleanups (22 April, 13 May, 17 June, 22 July, 19 August, and 7 October)
of Mill Creek in the Blue Heron Nature Preserve located in the Buckhead residential district of Atlanta, Georgia. Blue Heron
Nature Preserve lies in the Nancy Creek watershed of the City of Atlanta (City of Atlanta Department of Watershed Management 2021). 
The total cleanup area consisted of 74 marked 10-m sections along the creek (Fig. 1A, B) that began at a marsh pond, about 70 m
southeast of where Mill Creek merges with Nancy Creek, and ended upstream at the creek’s entrance to the pre- serve. The point 
(lat 33.86591, long 284.38047) immediately downstream from the study site within Mill Creek receives runoff from 3.47 km2, 
79.9% of which was classiﬁed in 2011 as developed and 34.4% as impervious (USGS 2016a). Because of interruptions by unnavigable terrain and private property, 
the study area was not entirely contiguous, and ∼200 m were excluded from the cleanups. Litter had not been removed from Mill Creek for at least 1 y prior to this
study (K. McCauley, former Blue Heron Nature Preserve Director, Atlanta, Georgia, personal communication). At the beginning of July 2020, between the June and July
cleanups, 6 new BDAs were installed and 2 existing BDAs were fortiﬁed within the Mill Creek study site (see Fig. 1Cfor an example BDA). These BDAs were completed through
a collaboration between the Blue Heron Nature Preserve and the City of Atlanta Department of Watershed Management. The ultimate goal of their project was to mitigate ur-
ban ﬂooding from the preserve’s surrounding Buckhead area (Blue Heron Nature Preserve n.d.). We used these BDA upgrades as an opportunity to assess the effects of
BDAs on stream litter and stream morphology.

### Collection

We combined community cleanup activities with the litter-categorization methodology suggested by Owens and Kamil (2020) to apply scientiﬁc 
methodology to our commu- nity service efforts (van Emmerik and Schwarz 2020). To maximize efﬁciency, volunteers split into 2 groups 
to clean up separate halves of the creek. Before beginning cleanups, volunteers were oriented on collection methods, study pur- pose, and 
how to ﬁeld questions from park visitors. They were instructed to collect all anthropogenic litter in a given 10-m section and bring it to 
the group leader for categoriza- tion and counting. Exceptions were made for anything dan- gerously heavy, deeply buried, or too deep to be collected without volunteers submerging.

We quantiﬁed litter by counting the number of items/section collected by volunteer surveyors. For each section, all human-attributable 
waste was collected from the creek and 3 m on each side of the bank, yielding 60 m2 of riparian zone/section. Because creek width varied,
the surface area of the creek varied by section. Surveyors navigated the bank from a central walking path, where they could visually
scan the entire 3-m section, and they were free to roam be- tween bank and creek areas as appropriate for each section’s terrain.
To expedite the cleanup process, surveyors acting as collectors navigated upstream. They collected litter 1 sec- tion at a time and
left it in piles for the cleanup leader to sort, categorize, and document. We did not clean, dry, or weigh the collected items. Only macrolitter 
items >0.5 cm (Moore et al. 2011, Bruge et al. 2018, van Emmerik and Schwarz 2020, Winton et al. 2020) were counted and categorized for this study,
but surveyors were encouraged to remove all items to aid the cleanup effort. Litter collection was not time limited. Surveyors moved to the
subsequent section when they could no longer ﬁnd items to collect in their current section.

One 30-m segment of the creek (sections 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) introduced complexities to the sampling process that re-quired altered methods.
These sections, where Mill Creek en- ters the Blue Heron Nature Preserve, lie near a concrete and metal architectural remnant that 
accumulates large quanti- ties of natural debris and litter. Section 0.2 contained the structure, section 0.1 encompassed the pool preceding the structure, 
and section 0.3 immediately followed the structure downstream. Because of practical constraints, ﬂoating litter from these sections was collected with 
2-mm-pore-size dip- nets and then sorted and categorized the following day. These ﬁrst 3 sections of the creek yielded particularly large numbers of polystyrene fragments. 
To quantify the polystyrene, 2 par- ticipants counted piles of 10 fragments at a time, announcing each count of 10, while 1 researcher kept a tally.

July were located within sections 2.2, 3.0, 4.5, 4.8, 5.2, and 5.5. The 2 preexisting BDAs that were reinforced in July were located within sections 1.7 
and 2.8. The BDA in section 2.0 existed in April but was removed in July. B.—Map showing the location of the study site relative to the City of Atlanta,

### Categorization

Items from each section were categorized by identity (e.g., tennis ball, water bottle), function (e.g., toy, smoking prod- uct), 
and material composition (e.g., polystyrene, metal) on a predesigned data sheet before being discarded (Appen- dix S1). Our data 
sheet was adapted from the sample out- lined by the NOAA Marine Debris Shoreline Survey Field Guide (Opfer et al. 2012). 
We documented items with as much speciﬁcity as possible to provide ﬂexibility when con- densing data into broader material and 
functional groups for analysis (Owens and Kamil 2020). Item identity and material composition were evaluated visually. Our material category
of polystyrene consisted exclusively of foamed polystyrene items. Hard polystyrene items were included in the “other plastics” category. 
All further references to polystyrene in this paper speciﬁcally refer to foamed polystyrene.

### Density

We calculated litter density as the number of items/m2 of surveyed surface area. The width of the creek varied, so we estimated 
the creek surface area for each section by multiplying creek width (April) at each marker by 10 m for each section (mean ± SD: 51.5 ± 21.3 m2). 
We summed all sections to obtain total creek surface area (3961.38 m2). The study area also included 3 m on both banks (60 m2/plot), 
yielding a total surface area of 8581.38 m2 of terrain cleaned during this study.

### Accumulation rate

We assumed that after the initial cleanup, only newly ac- cumulated litter would be encountered. Under this assump- tion, 
we calculated the area-speciﬁc litter-accumulation 22 d 21 by dividing the litter density rate in terms of items m⁻² d⁻¹  dividing the litter density 
by the number of days that had passed since the previous cleanup.

### Time and BDA effects on litter count and category

To test for the effects of time and BDA presence on stream litter, we used JMP® software (version 16; SAS Insti- tute, 
Cary, North Carolina) to perform repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (rmMANOVA). Data used were raw 
counts of untransformed litter totals. We chose to use rmnMANOVaAs because our temporal replicates were not 
random samples of the study area but were taken re- peatedly at the same sections. Because the number of BDAs increased 
between June and July samples, we performed sep- arate rmMANOVAs for April-to-June and July-to-October litter datasets. 
Each analysis included all 74 plots sampled at 3 time points (time factor composed of April, May, and June samples or June, 
July, and October samples) with each section coded as either containing a BDA or not. The re- sponse variables were total 
litter count and each separate material category (plastic, polystyrene, metal, glass, paper, wood, ceramic, rubber, and textile). 
For all rmMANOVAs, we assessed the effects of BDA presence, time, and their in- teraction, BDA x time. We considered an
« level of 0.05 for identifying statistical relationships, but we interpret our sta- tistics conservatively because of the 
large number of tests and focus on the direction and magnitude of relationships.

### Creek morphology

We collected creek morphology measurements during April, August, and November 2020 at each 10-m mark. A researcher assisted 
by volunteers used a tape measure to measure from water’s edge to water’s edge (creek width) and from creek bed to water surface (creek depth).

To assess the relationship between creek morphol- ogy and BDAs, we also used JMP software to perform an rmMANOVA. The August 
creek morphology measure- ments were strongly inﬂuenced by recent rains, so to test the effects of BDA upgrades on creek morphology, 
we ex- cluded the August sample to allow comparison between before- and after-upgrade periods during baseflow condi- tions. 
Therefore, April and November creek width and depth were response variables and BDA presence/absence was the categorical 
predictor variable. As with the rmMANOVA to test BDA and time effects on litter, we assessed the effects of BDA presence, 
time, and their interaction, BDA x time.

### Precipitation data

We expected rain events to deliver most of the litter to the creek and adjacent riparian zone. To address this prediction, 
we obtained the number and quantity of precipi- tation events from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) online 
database (USGS 2016b). USGS, via the City of Atlanta Department of Watershed Management, tracks a real-time (15-min resolution) 
stream gauge and water- quality monitor located ∼380 m upstream of where our study creek merges into Nancy Creek.

To assess the predicted association between litter ac- cumulation and precipitation events, we used correlation analysis. 
We used JMP software to compute simple Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for monthly litter totals and accu- mulation rates
with rainfall parameters. We excluded the 1st monthly (April) litter total and included only the last 5 monthly litter totals 
in correlation analysis because the lit- ter accumulated for an unknown period of time before the 1st cleanup.

### Overview

Over the course of 6 cleanups, a total of 14,520 items of litter were collected and removed from an area of 8581.38 m2 (Table 1). 
Between cleanups (20–49 d apart), there were 4 to 22 rain events (days of rain) totaling 5.13 to 27.00 cm. To- tal precipitation 
levels ﬂuctuated throughout the study be- cause of 5 large (>2.54 cm) rain events in total, 3 of which preceded the August cleanup. 
The density of litter found during all cleanups ranged from 0.19 to 1.66 items/m2 with a mean density and standard deviation of 0.60 ± 0.54 items/ m2. 
The 1st cleanup accounted for ∼½ the total number of litter items collected. Subsequent accumulation rates 22 d 21 with a mean 
of ranged from 0.01 to 0.03 items m⁻²d⁻¹. 0.01 ± 0.01 items with a mean of 0.01 ± 0.01 items m⁻²d⁻¹.

### Composition

Proportions of litter materials varied across study sec- tions and sampling periods, but polystyrene and plastic constituted 
most litter across both space and time. Cumula- tively, most of the litter collected across cleanups was made of (foamed) 
polystyrene (56.4%) and other plastics (36.3%), and the remaining items were primarily made of glass (2.8%) and metal (2.6%; Fig. 2A). 
Material composition was qualitatively similar among the 6 cleanups. Combined plas- tics (polystyrene and other plastics) 
were consistently the largest represented group in material composition, making up at least 86% of litter collected during 
each cleanup and representing 92.7% of total litter collected across all clean- ups. Polystyrene was the largest material 
class of litter col- lected before BDA upgrades (April–June), but the relative proportion of other plastics surpassed that 
of polystyrene after BDA upgrades (July–August). Polystyrene then re- gained a slight lead over other plastics in October.

Although an overwhelming majority of the items col- lected were unidentiﬁable (polystyrene) fragments, identity and functional 
categories could be discerned for most other items. These items were predominantly single-use con- sumer products like food and 
beverage packaging, which in- cluded non-polystyrene plastic wrappers, bottles, and straws as well as polystyrene take-out 
food and beverage containers (Table S1, Fig. 2B).

Percentage of litter items by material collected each month from Mill Creek, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, in 2020. Mean and 
standard deviation for % of litter items categorized by material type across all cleanups are, from largest to smallest, 
as follows: polystyrene (49.04 ± 11.29), other plastics (42.37 ± 9.65), glass (3.23 ± 2.55), metal (3.03 ± 1.15), rubber (0.78 ± 0.51), 
textiles (0.54 ± 0.45), paper (0.39 ± 0.35), wood (0.29 ± 0.26), ceramics (0.23 ± 0.27), and other (0.10 ± 0.11). B.—Percentage of 
litter items by functional category collected each month from Mill Creek in 2020. Mean and standard deviation for % of items 
categorized by functional category across all cleanups are, from largest to smallest, as follows: fragments (63.97 ± 11.04), 
food packaging (13.73 ± 4.76), beverage packag- ing (12.30 ± 4.38), other (3.06 ± 1.30), plastic bags (2.69 ± 1.32), 
smoking products (1.28 ± 0.27), toys (1.11 ± 0.61), clothing (0.72 ± 0.40), construction (0.71 ± 0.38), and hygiene products (0.43 ± 0.24). 

### Spatial and temporal litter distribution

**Total litter accumulation Litter accumulation varied** both spatially and temporally throughout the study. Total litter 
accumulation was higher at sites with BDAs both before (April–June; mean 5 300.6 items/section; Table 2) and af- ter BDA 
upgrades (July–October; mean 5 127.8 items/ section) than those without BDAs (mean 5 38.8 and 12.3 items/section before 
and after upgrades, respectively). Before BDA upgrades, most of the litter accumulated in the ﬁrst 3 sections of the creek, 
where it was caught by the debris dam (Fig. 3). Following additional BDA upgrades, litter increased at most dam locations 
along the creek as litter accumulated in and above the intact dams. Most of the creek’s litter was still caught at the 
dam at section 0.2, consistent with the ﬁndings of the April to June cleanups.

Relationships between litter accumulation, BDA presence, and time differed before and after BDA upgrades. Total litter 
count (April—June) was affected by time, BDA pres- ence, and their interaction, time x BDA (rmMANOVA; Tables $2, $3). 
April had higher average total litter counts than May and June, and non-BDAs had greater proportional reductions than 
BDAs in total litter count after April (see monthly least squared means in Table S2). This time x BDA interaction resulted 
in BDA plots going from having ~4x more total litter than non-BDA plots in April to having >12x more in May and June. 
From July to October, there was also a strong positive effect of BDA presence on total lit- ter count but no effects of 
time or the interaction between time and BDAs (rmMANOVA,; Tables S2, $3). BDA plots ranged from having ~8 x more litter 
in July to <2 more in August and 4.6 more litter in October.

**Individual litter materials** For individual material cate- gories, BDA presence consistently increased accumulation of some, 
but not all, litter materials. Counts of 3 materi- als (plastic, metal, and rubber) were higher in BDA plots than non-BDA plots 
both before and after BDA upgrades (rmMANOVA,; Tables 2, $2, $3). Wood litter counts were higher in BDA plots than non-BDA 
plots before upgrades but not after. In contrast, glass counts were not consistently different before upgrades but were up to 4x
higher in BDA plots after. Paper and ceramic counts were not affected by BDA plots during either time period.

Similarly, time affected litter accumulation both before and after BDA upgrades for some materials but not others. 
Polystyrene and wood were affected by time before BDA upgrades, where they both showed highest counts in April and lowest 
in May, but they were not affected by time after. Plastic, metal, and textiles (highest counts in August) and glass (highest counts in July) 
all differed by time after up- grades but not before. Paper and rubber varied weakly over time during both time periods, but ceramic 
litter counts were not affected by time during either time period. The interactive effect of BDAs and time also differed among materials 
before and after BDA upgrades (rmMANOVA; Table S3).
For example, there was an interactive effect of BDA presence x time in both time periods for rubber, but there was no interactive 
effect in either time period for paper, ce- ramic, or textiles. The effect of BDAs on polystyrene and wood counts changed over 
time before upgrades but not af- ter. In April, the polystyrene counts were ~4x greater in BDA plots than non-BDA plots, 
whereas in June BDA plots had ~31x higher counts than non-BDA plots. Wood, which had very low counts overall, had similar 
counts in BDA plots and non-BDA plots in May but ~10x greater counts in BDA plots in June. In contrast, the effect of BDAs 
changed over time for plastic, metal, and glass after, but not before, BDA updates. During July to October, plastic counts 
ranged from ~2.5 to 9x higher in BDAs than non-BDAs, and metal ranged from ~1.5 to 8x higher. Glass counts during July and 
August were up to 6x greater in BDA plots, but in Oc- tober, glass counts were slightly greater in non-BDA plots.

**Summary of the effects of beaver dam analogues (BDA) on total litter accumulation** accumulation of plastic and polystyrene litter, 
and creek morphology (creek width and depth) for Mill Creek, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, in 2020. Time periods for litter response 
variables are before (April–June) and after (July–October) BDA upgrades. Time periods for creek morphology vari- ables are 
at the beginning of the study (April) and at the end (November). Means are adjusted means from repeated measures multivariate 
analysis of variance (rmMANOVA) for each time period, and ranges reﬂect the means from each individual month within the 
time period for litter variables and from plot level measurements for morphology variables. Units of mean values for litter 
response variables are items/section. Units of mean values for creek morphology variables are in m.

### Creek morphology

Creek morphology was not consistently affected by time or BDA upgrades. Some plots experienced erosion around 
the banks of the BDAs, some remained unaffected, and others experienced erosion underneath the BDAs. However, neither 
creek width nor depth were consistently affected by BDAs or the time x BDA interaction ((mMANOVA; Table S3). Creek depth,
but not width, was affected by time because the creek was deeper in November than in April.

Litter accumulation did not correlate with precipitation. Monthly litter total, accumulation rate, and litter density 
were not affected by days since last cleanup, total rain since last cleanup, number of days with rain since last cleanup, 
or number of rain events exceeding 2.54, 1.27, or 0.64 cm (p > 0.05 for all 24 bivariate Pearson correlation tests).

## Discussion

This study combines community creek cleanup ap- proaches used by nature centers and local environmental groups with scientiﬁc 
quantiﬁcation and classiﬁcation to as- sess the sources and accumulation rates of anthropogenic litter in an urban stream. 
Our results show that the main types of anthropogenic litter that accumulate in the Blue Heron Nature Preserve’s Mill Creek 
are single-use plastics and polystyrene fragments carried by runoff from the sur- rounding roads, residential properties, 
and businesses. BDAs installed as part of creek restoration efforts had variable and inconsistent effects on creek morphology, 
but caused in- creases in litter accumulation in ﬂoating debris types that often varied in magnitude over time.

### Litter counts and accumulation rate

The amount of litter removed from the creek during cleanups may be driven by changes over time, the presence of BDAs and 
their effects on stream geomorphology, and unpredictable interactions with stormwater-runoff dynam- ics. The large initial 
litter counts in April (Table 1) were a result of litter accumulating prior to creek cleanups, which exempliﬁes the 
impact of repeat cleanups on litter preva- lence. Total litter removed generally decreased from the initial peak, but 
accumulation rates ﬂuctuated in the fol- lowing months. Barriers to surface ﬂow contributed to this variation in the 
form of natural and constructed obstacles. Between the June and July cleanups, a storm felled some trees, which caused an 
accumulation of trash in the creek immediately upstream of our study area. This prevented some litter from reaching the 
study area for the July cleanup. These trees were substantially ﬂooded between the July and August cleanups, releasing the 
trapped litter, which may help explain the increased litter collected in August as compared with July. Although the time 
period preceding the October cleanup experienced the largest volume of rainfall, the span between the July and August 
cleanups had the greatest number of large rain events, and ∼70% more lit- ter was collected in August than in October. 
Complex dynamics between buildup of litter source material on land and transport opportunities in stormwater runoff appear 
to make litter accumulation in our study area non-linear and uncorrelated with respect to simple rainfall metrics such as 
total precipitation, number of days with rain, and number of rain events exceeding various thresholds.

Although we observed increases in riparian litter follow ing large ﬂooding events, the relationship between precipitation 
and total litter accumulation is not clear. Litter moves at faster rates in the streams than in the riparian zones 
(Mc- Cormick and Hoellein 2016) and, presumably, even faster when ﬂoating at the surface than when submerged. Litter 
accumulation behind obstructions during normal ﬂow re- gimes could be exported from the site during high ﬂows as ﬂood 
waters lift ﬂoating debris over obstacles. However, litter does not accumulate at a constant rate in the environ- ment, 
and litter input to the creek is not consistent, regard- less of rain levels. Litter takes time to accumulate, so storms 
on consecutive days would not capture the same amount of litter as similar storms spaced weeks apart. Additionally, 
spatial variation of precipitation within the watershed could affect the type and amount of litter captured by runoff. 
As seen elsewhere (e.g., Bhandaram et al. 2011), total precipita- tion and rain events did not correlate with our measured 
litter-accumulation rates. In another study, ﬂoating-litter counts in the Rhône River did not correlate with rainfall to- tals, 
because complex short-term dynamics, such as remo- bilization of trapped litter and stormwater overﬂow, caused high 
variability in short-term litter pulses (Castro-Jiménez et al. 2019). Similarly, ﬂow rates of rivers in Jakarta did 
not correlate with litter load, because litter input rates prob- ably varied, and storm runoff can deplete litter sources 
between frequent rain events (van Emmerik et al. 2019).

Our study included a few limitations that could have af- fected our measures of accumulation rates. First, our calculated 
accumulation rate was an estimate of the creek’s net accumulation, which does not include the litter that was exported 
from the creek between cleanups (Vincent and Hoellein 2017). Therefore, we expect that there was likely more litter 
moving through the preserve than di- rectly observed by this study. Litter traps or remote imaging techniques in future 
studies could provide valuable data on these missing values. Second, several factors may have contributed to litter 
being missed during cleanups and a resulting undercount of litter items. A small number of items were left behind because 
of inaccessible location or dangerous conditions (e.g., deep water, animal carcasses). Throughout the summer, riparian 
vegetation grew substan- tially, making the banks more difﬁcult to navigate and ob- scuring some litter from view, so 
items were easier to miss. During the August cleanup, 1 litter pile was missed and par- tially swept away by rain before
it could be collected the fol- lowing day. The combined total quantity of known lost or unretrieved litter in the study
is very small relative to the to- tals collected (<0.1% of grand totals), so we are conﬁdent that it does not substantially 
bias the results.

### Litter density

Our litter density results (0.1921.66 items/m2) were comparable to densities reported by similar studies. Evaluation of 5 streams in the Chicago metropolitan
area yielded similar results, with mean riparian litter density of 0.293 item/m2 and mean benthic litter density of 0.117 
item/m2 (McCor- mick and Hoellein 2016). A combination of large and small rivers in Germany also exhibited densities within 
our data range (mean density of 0.54 item/m2; Kiessling et al. 2019). However, the average density along Indonesia’s Tukad Badung River was 
close to the upper bound of our dataset (1.19 items/m2; Owens and Kamil 2020), and the average density found near India’s Karamana River
was much higher than our data range (3.26 items/m2; Owens and Kamil 2020). Differences in stream litter density could be related to 
differences in river size, hydrology, the size of the surround- ing population, and methodological approaches. The Owens and Kamil (2020) 
study in Indonesia and India investigated litter accumulation along water bodies of larger magnitude than our very small urban creek. 
Larger rivers often experi- ence higher litter densities (Kiessling et al. 2019) and higher ﬂow rates and volumes to carry and deposit 
litter. Larger rivers also typically drain a larger watershed and are more ac- cessible and attractive to visitors who are liable to 
pollute the area (Kiessling et al. 2019). However, these elevated litter densities do not appear to directly correlate to population density of the study regions, 
given the highest litter densities were found in the Indian state of Kerala, which is less pop- ulous (860 persons/km2 in 2011; Census of India 2011) 
than both Indonesia’s Denpasar municipality (7022 persons/km2 in 2016; Rahayu et al. 2018) and the city of Atlanta (1218 persons/km2 in 2010; USCB 2020). 
Another consideration is that litter collection in larger rivers often only includes ﬂoat- ing debris or riparian litter accrual and overlooks benthic litter accumulation, 
which may lead to underreporting of the site’s true litter content, making direct comparison with litter accumulation studies in smaller streams difﬁcult.

### Distribution of litter

Based on our dataset and observations, we deduce that runoff is a key factor driving the distribution of litter and that 
BDAs and other physical barriers drive its accumula- tion. We observed the highest densities of litter concen- trated 
at the dams and located in the creek. Most other items were found deposited in the root systems hanging from the banks 
or on land after ﬂooding. This pattern in- dicates that most items were swept to the preserve by run- off. Had the litter 
entered the preserve by other means, we would have expected to see different dispersal patterns. For example, we would 
expect direct littering by preserve visi- tors to be scattered in the riparian zone and pedestrian walk- ways rather 
than accumulated at the dams and bank walls. If illegal dumping was a source, we would expect to ﬁnd large concentrated 
piles at the dump site.

The longitudinal distribution of litter aligns with obser- vations of potential litter trapping sites. Before the BDA upgrades, 
most of the litter was collected at the structure located in section 0.2 (Fig. 3). From April to June, BDAs had a substantial
positive effect on total litter count and on many individual material categories (Tables 2, S2, S3). For the July, August, and October cleanups, 
the largest accumulation of litter was still at the 0.2 structure. Other accumulation mostly occurred around the new and refurbished 
BDAs. However, there were also peaks in the marsh pond region (sites 7.5–6.0) that did not contain BDAs. The marsh pond is 
immediately adja- cent to the busy Roswell Road, downstream from the rest of Mill Creek, and has low banks that become inundated 
with water during rain events. Most of the litter in this re- gion was collected from the ﬂoodplain, where the litter is deposited by ﬂoodwaters.

### Composition

Consistent with similar composition studies, most of the litter collected at Mill Creek was plastic (Williams and Simmons 1999,
Rech et al. 2015, Willis et al. 2017, Kiessling et al. 2019, Owens and Kamil 2020; Fig. 2A), and most items collected were 
polystyrene and other plastic fragments (Fig. 2B). The deterioration into fragments is an indication of exposure to elements, 
particularly the impact of trans- porting rains and creek currents (Hoellein et al. 2014). Our data show that the proportion
of both polystyrene litter and fragments decreased over the course of our study, and we ob- served anecdotally that polystyrene
fragment size increased over that same period. During our ﬁrst 2 cleanups, we col- lected large quantities of very small fragments
below our 5-mm-macrolitter threshold (which we did not count). Later in the study, this material was not nearly as abundant, 
and polystyrene fragments tended to be larger, cleaner, and more durable. These observations suggest that polystyrene 
becomes increasingly fragile and fragmented over time and that smaller fragments have been circulating as litter for 
longer periods of time than larger, less-weathered frag- ments. We conclude that polystyrene entered the creek in 
larger pieces that broke down into smaller fragments. Perhaps the observed decrease in relative composition of 
polystyrene and fragments would not have existed had we assessed the mass of these fragments instead of item count 
(i.e., as fragments broke apart, the count increased but mass did not).

The functional categorization of the litter indicates that, other than fragments, the litter was primarily single-use 
con- sumer and household items. This result is similar to ﬁndings in rivers of both Indonesia and India (Owens and Kamil 2020), 
Great Lake beaches in the US (Vincent et al. 2017), and a beach in Brazil (Araújo and Costa 2007). Further, the litter 
found in Mill Creek was dominated by single-use pack- aging and smoking-related materials, including a large number of 
snack wrappers, plastic bottles, and cigarillo tips, which was similar to ﬁndings in German rivers (Kiessling et al. 2019).

For most of our cleanups, we had >1 person responsible for identifying and categorizing items, which left room for mismatch
in how a single item might be categorized. Ad- ditionally, some of the categories are not mutually exclu- sive or 
could be interpreted differently depending on the classiﬁer. For example, a plastic sandwich bag may have been 
included in the plastic bag category, the other-food-related category, or considered a ﬁlmed plastic. 
We expect that the potential lack of uniformity may have skewed our counts in those categories by a negligible amount. 
In future studies, we suggest establishing clear categorization deﬁnitions and direction prior to study to alleviate 
this inconsistency. Also, we could have categorized with a higher degree of speciﬁcity, such as splitting plastic bags 
into grocery, garbage, and sand- wich bags, to further improve standardization (Owens and Kamil 2020).

Another limitation to our results is that our collection methods bias for ﬂoating debris. Floating plastics are visually 
obvious and are more likely to be caught in dams and washed onto banks than are denser materials, like metal, glass, 
and ceramics, which can submerge in the creek and are often buried out of view by sediment on the creek bed (McCormick and Hoellein 2016). 
Additionally, items like glass and ceramic fragments are easily camouﬂaged by creek-bed sediments. However, 
they are chemically inert and pose less of an envi- ronmental concern than plastics (Vincent and Hoellein 2017). 
Glass and ceramic fragments are also less mobile than plastics and, therefore, are less likely to move downstream 
to contribute to marine litter, but they are more likely to become a relatively permanent addition to the creek substrate.

### Litter sources

Litter input sources to Mill Creek are constrained by the surrounding land types and uses. Blue Heron Nature Preserve is 
surrounded by residential neighborhoods, and much of Mill Creek ﬂows parallel to private property. Within the watershed, 
there are multiple shopping centers, including Buckhead Station and Phillips Plaza, and a section of a ma- jor freeway, 
Georgia State Route 400. Mill Creek is not close to any manufacturing facilities, larger scale industrial com- plexes, or 
illegal dumping sites, which eliminates these as potential litter sources.

We can infer the sources of much of the collected litter by examining the litter itself. The nature of a large proportion 
of the items we collected, single-use food and bever- age packaging and smoking paraphernalia, is the kind of litter we 
would expect to ﬁnd on streets and in poorly se- cured garbage receptacles of Atlanta. Some of the items could be directly 
connected to businesses or addresses in the area, such as logoed fast-food containers, objects from nearby plant nurseries, 
and mail with delivery addresses. Many of the household items we found were children’s toys, sports equip- ment, and 
gardening equipment. These items could have been picked up by ﬂoodwaters from the steep neighboring backyards and 
transported by wind and water to the creek. From the lack of deterioration of the non-fragmented items, we surmise that 
they had either been recently discarded or were not intended to be trash. A much smaller proportion of the items were 
clearly dated, such as degraded beer cans with pull tabs, which we found emerging from the eroding creek-bank walls. 
The distribution of litter across the study site also supports the watershed’s culpability, rather than direct 
littering by park visitors. We conclude that the primary sources of litter in Mill Creek were streets and backyards 
within the watershed and that this litter was likely carried to the preserve by storm runoff.

Erosion of creek banks is a minor source of litter. The creek banks visibly eroded throughout the summer, particularly 
after the upgrades of the BDAs and the ﬂash ﬂoods in August. Erosion was visible at certain BDAs as widen- ing or
deepening of the creek between the April and No- vember morphology measurements. However, we found that these effects 
were not consistent across all BDAs (p 5 0.67 and 0.35 for effect of BDAs on creek width and depth, respectively; Table S3),
which suggests that local stream sedimentary and structural physiographies (e.g., exposed rocks, tree roots, etc.) are 
critical to controlling whether erosion occurs in the stream bed, as bank erosion, both, or neither. The bank erosion 
revealed historic buried litter, primarily older glass bottles and beer cans with pull tabs. Mill Creek was 
dammed to form a lake for many decades before the dam was broken in 2003 (K. McCauley, former Blue Heron Nature 
Preserve Director, Atlanta, Georgia, per- sonal communication). Sedimentary layers were visible in some parts of the 
creek bank, and these layers included lit- ter that had been buried in the lake bottom and that was eroding into the 
creek during our study. Over the course of the study, we estimate that ∼100 pieces of litter were collected from those 
strata, so the erosion did not produce a large proportion of the total litter collected (<0.8%). This very small 
contribution of eroded litter in our study sup- ports the idea that stormwater ﬂows bring in new litter to the preserve 
and uncover historic litter. It is also likely that stormwater brings in litter that is buried by sediment during hurricanes 
and other high-ﬂow events, but further research is necessary to quantify this mechanism.

### Implications of COVID-19

This study occurred in 2020, concurrent with the COVID- 19 pandemic. The pandemic affected a wide range of factors that 
could contribute to patterns in litter amount, dis- tribution, and category, such as vehicle trafﬁc, consumer purchasing 
patterns, park visitors, and the types of litter en- countered. The Georgia Department of Transportation collects 
trafﬁc-volume data at the corner of Roswell Road and Lakemoore Drive, where the marsh pond is located. 
Trafﬁc volume from the last full week of April exhibited a >50% decrease from 2018 to 2020 (204,447 cars in 2018 vs 
97,408 cars in 2020; Georgia Department of Transportation n.d.). Sim- ilarly, with the temporary closure of 
many businesses and shelter-in-place recommendations, we expect that foot traf- ﬁc outside the park likely decreased.
We suspect that these reductions in human trafﬁc would have led to a decrease in street litter and, subsequently, a 
decrease in litter enter- ing the preserve during this time. For that reason, we believe that the data collected 
during this study were likely an underrepresentation of pre-pandemic litter levels and typical accumulation rates. 
However, the pandemic likely in- troduced increases in speciﬁc litter items, such as take-away paraphernalia and protective 
gear such as masks and gloves. Gloves (46 collected) were uniformly distributed throughout the survey period, but 3
out of 4 total masks were collected after 15 August, when local governments were permitted to enact mask mandates in 
Georgia (State of Georgia 2020). We also observed an increase in visitors to Blue Heron Nature Preserve 
following improvements to accessibility, including new bridges and boardwalks, as well as an apparent increase 
in outdoor recreation resulting from pandemic-related life- style changes.

### Community service

Community service was an important aspect of this study. Although we recognize that cleanups are not a long-term solution 
to the litter problem (Owens and Kamil 2020), cleanup efforts can effectively reduce litter in the short term (Vincent and Hoellein 2017)
to enhance the wellbeing of our local wild- life and create a safer space for visitors. Community science efforts can promote public 
awareness of litter issues (Rech et al. 2015, Owens and Kamil 2020), and they recruit additional human resources that can 
expand the scale of a study (Vincent et al. 2017, Kiessling et al. 2019). Additionally, volunteer and researcher interactions 
with Blue Heron Nature Preserve visitors during cleanups created another layer of outreach and established support for our efforts within the community.

### Impacts on wildlife

Cleanup efforts can have unintended ecological con- sequences, including to wildlife. While dipnetting ﬂoating polystyrene 
fragments upstream of the debris dam at 0.2, we collected a large quantity of ﬂoating woody debris as well as Southern 
Two-lined Salamander (Eurycea cirrigera) larvae (51) and adults (2) and Green Frog (Lithobates cla- mitans) tadpoles (2) and adult (1). 
To reduce mortality of amphibian bycatch, we encourage researchers and cleanup crews to poke holes in litter 
collection bags so amphibians have access to oxygen and to store bags in cool, shaded locations for as short a time as 
possible before being sorted. Animals can be safely kept in water in non-airtight containers during the sorting process 
and returned immediately to their collection site.

Removal of litter could also result in the unintentional removal of materials used by fauna. Floating polystyrene is not widely 
known to provide refuges and habitat heterogeneity for amphibians, but their use of terrestrial and submerged plastic 
trash as cover objects has been reported previously (Neill 1948). However, we expect that removing the trash has a net beneﬁt 
to amphibian assemblages be- cause microplastics are rapidly consumed by amphibian larvae in a dose-dependent manner (Hu et al. 2016), 
and these environmental pollutants are toxic and mutagenic (da Costa Araújo et al. 2020).

Future directions

Our litter accumulation study met the twin goals of combining the community beneﬁts of creek cleanup with quantiﬁcation 
and scientiﬁc evaluation and shedding light on the missing plastics problem (Schmidt et al. 2017, Owens and Kamil 2020). 
We observed Mill Creek to be a trans- porter of litter to its higher order stream, Nancy Creek, a temporary stop for litter 
that is remobilized during heavy ﬂoods, and a sink for litter accumulation. Repeated clean- ups, as employed in this study, 
are useful both as a short- term litter-mitigation measure and as a method to assess litter-accumulation rates. 
With repeated cleanups, the litter is also more likely to be collected earlier in its life cycle. Pre weathered plastics 
can be collected in larger pieces before they degrade to more problematic microplastics. We encourage future 
researchers and environmental groups to adopt similar methodology so they can improve their local environment and 
create useful and standardized data on stream litter to inform their stakeholders and scientiﬁc debates.

Regular cleanups have reduced Mill Creek’s litter in the short term, but we need intervention from the City of Atlanta 
Department of Watershed Management to capture litter before it reaches our creeks and rivers. The city should consider 
implementing litter-trap technologies in Nancy Creek similar to those installed in Atlanta’s Proctor Creek (Wiener and White 2020). 
Future challenges involve cut- ting litter off at its source by reducing the production and use of single-use plastic and 
improving street litter manage- ment (Blettler and Wantzen 2019).
