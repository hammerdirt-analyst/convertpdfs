#### Preface

Proximity to citizens: that is what citizen
science and local government have in common.
Nevertheless, local governments often do not
spontaneously think of citizen science as (part of) a
solution for local issues. In essence, citizen science

is about scientific research that is conducted - in

whole or in part - by the general public. Therefore,
at first glance, it seems to be something for
scientists and citizens, but in many cases local
government is also involved, for example when it

comes to measurements and research that can

reinforce local policy. Through citizen science
projects, cities and towns gain access to an
extensive network of locally engaged citizens, who
are the ideal citizen scientists in such projects.
Citizen science can provide new data and insights
for a local government to back up supported policy
choices. Therein lies great potential for the local
policy level, whether it is a large city, a rural village
or a single residential area.

In this roadmap, we outline what citizen science
can mean for local government, explain how to get


started and identify success factors. You will find
lots of inspiring examples, and in the online version
you will also find videos (in Dutch) related to the
chapters of this roadmap.

This roadmap is an initiative of Flemish minister
Bart Somers and Agentschap Binnenlands

Bestuur of the Government of Flanders. The

roadmap is the result of a close cooperation with
all 13 Flemish central cities (‘centrumsteden’),
Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, the
towns of Aalter, Halle, Harelbeke and Zoersel,
Vereniging van Vlaamse Steden en Gemeenten
vzw, Kenniscentrum voor Vlaamse steden and

the citizen science network of Scivil (the Flemish
Knowledge Centre on Citizen Science). Insights
and experiences were gathered through interviews
and participatory workshops.

All involved parties hope you gain inspiration
through this roadmap.

###### A roadmap made for Flanders translated to English


This roadmap was originally written in Dutch for a

Flemish audience in a Flemish context. It has now

been translated to English, for European and wider
dissemination. This is why you will come across
a lot of Flemish examples of citizen science, as
well as referrals to Flemish and Belgian political,
social and educational structures. Hyperlinks refer
to an English webpage, if available. Dutch names
of publications, projects and institutions are, by
default, not translated. For the benefit of easy
reading, we explain certain concepts and add a
limited glossary below.

###### Explanations
Belgium and Flanders
Flanders refers to the Dutch-speaking region and
community within the federal state of Belgium. It
has its own regional parliament and government,
responsible for a large number of policy domains,
including - among others - education, culture,
media, environment, agriculture, work and

innovation. [More info about the Government of](https://www.vlaanderen.be/en)

[Flanders.](https://www.vlaanderen.be/en)

City or town
Flanders consists of 300 municipalities
(‘gemeentes’) across 5 provinces. Each
municipality has its own local administration
with elected representatives and officials. Since
the term ‘municipality’ has a different meaning
depending on the national context, in this
roadmap, the dual term ‘city or town’ refers to
any local governmental structure with its own
administration and elected representatives and
officials, be it a rural village or a large metropole.

Local administration and local government
In this roadmap, the terms ‘local administration’
and ‘local government’ both serve as an umbrella
term for the democratically elected board and
the civil services of a city or town. ‘City council’
exclusively refers to the democratically elected
representatives of that city or town.

(Vocational) universities

In general, the Flemish higher education
system is divided in two types of institutions:
‘universiteiten’ providing in academic research
and education on a bachelor’s, master’s and
doctoral level; and ‘hogescholen’ focusing on
vocational education on a (pre)bachelor’s degree


and conducting applied research. The structure
of the higher education system differs from
country to country. In this roadmap, Flemish
higher education institutions are referred to as
‘(vocational) universities’.

###### Glossary
Centrumstad (central city):
a larger city in Flanders that serves as the regional
centre within its locality. Flanders has 13 centre

cities.

Stadswachter (City guard):
a civil servant in Flanders with limited policing
power, focusing on prevention, correction and
service-providing in the public domain.

Intercommunale (intermunicipal company):
a partnership between multiple adjacent towns
and cities in Flanders, in order to organize various
community services.

OCMW (Public Centre for Social Welfare):

a public institution providing in social services for
Belgian citizens. Each city or town in Belgium (and
thus in Flanders) has its own OCMW.

Vereniging van Vlaamse Steden en Gemeenten
vzw (Association of Flemish Cities and
Municipalities): a member association, advocating
on a policy level for the interests of cities and

towns in Flanders.

Vlaams Agentschap (Flemish Agency):
a Flemish government organisation, responsible for
policy implementation within one of the ten policy

domains of the Government of Flanders.

Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij (Flemish
Environmental Agency): an agency of the
Government of Flanders working towards a better
environment in Flanders, in the domains of water,

air and the environment.

Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie (Flemish
Community Commission): the government
administration for Flemings living in the BrusselsCapital Region. The VGC is responsible for all
communal policy domains: urban policy, culture,
youth, education, formation, student affairs, wellbeing, health and family.

## Citizen science: what is it about?

###### The meaning of the term citizen science can vary quite a bit. In this chapter we will discuss the nature, the means and the underlying motives of citizen science in general. The specific applications and contexts for local government will be discussed in detail in later chapters.

The meaning of the term citizen science can vary

quite a bit. In this chapter we will discuss the nature,
the means and the underlying motives of citizen
science in general. The specific applications and
contexts for local government will be discussed in

detail in later chapters.

###### What is citizen science?

There are several definitions of citizen science.

We use the following definition:

######  Citizen science involves scientific research conducted in whole or in part by non scientists (citizens), often in collaboration with, or under the guidance of professional scientists.”

Citizen science refers to research conducted (in part)

by citizen scientists, volunteers who contribute to

research in their free time. Citizen scientists often

- but not always - collaborate with, or are supervised

by domain experts, academics or governments.


For a more detailed framework, we refer to the

[Ten Principles of Citizen Science, developed by the](https://ecsa.citizen-science.net/documents/)
European Citizen Science Association (ECSA).

In recent decades, citizen science has gained

popularity across the world. In Flanders, widely

[various Luftdaten air quality measurements have also](https://luftdaten.info/)

put citizen science on the map.

The most well-known examples of citizen science
in Flanders perform(ed) research on biodiversity,
mobility and air quality, but there are also successful

applications in other domains, such as:

_[T genealogy (MamaMito)](https://historiesvzw.be/projecten/mamamito/)_
_[T history](https://velehanden.nl/)_

_[T well-being (Researching Age-Friendly Cities)](https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/do-engagement/inspire-me/case-studies/researching-age-friendly-neighbourhoods)_


On this graph, we visualize citizen science projects in Flanders that were active in April 2021, and known to Scivil. We suspect
that a large number of small-scale citizen science initiatives remain under Scivil’s radar. It is therefore possible that a number
of projects are not included in these counts.

###### How does citizen science work? Without scientific research, we cannot speak of
citizen science. Therefore, in a citizen science project,

questions that help to determine whether a project is

citizen science or not:

in the research?

Citizen scientists are most often involved in data collection or analysis, but it is particularly valuable when

they also contribute to other steps in the research process.

###### Is this citizen science or not?

[On FixMyStreet, citizens can report incidents in public space (trash,](https://fixmystreet.brussels/)
damaged sidewalks, broken traffic lights, etc.) to their city or town. While
volunteers often upload photos and observations to an application or
online platform in citizen science, in FixMyStreet they are not uploaded

to contribute to research. A very valuable initiative, but we do not call it

citizen science.

The photos and observations of animals and plants uploaded to
[Waarnemingen.be, are collected in a large database available for research](https://waarnemingen.be/)

on biodiversity. This contribution to research is why we consider

Waarnemingen.be to be citizen science.

[The Gemeente-Stadsmonitor is a policy monitor that assesses the broad](https://www.vlaanderen.be/gemeenten-en-provincies/organisatie-en-werking-van-gemeenten/gemeentemonitor)
environment of a city or town using about 300 indicators or sets of figures.
More than 100 of these come from a large-scale three-yearly citizen
survey. In all 300 Flemish cities and towns, citizens are invited to fill in a

questionnaire to evaluate how they experience living in their city or town.

Although we can certainly call this citizen survey a research, the citizens
only contribute by answering a questionnaire. Therefore, they are part of

the research, but do not take an active role in it. It is large-scale research,

but not citizen science.

[Straatvinken engages citizen scientists to count traffic in their street once](https://straatvinken.be/about-straatvinken/)
a year for one hour. The results of this count are analysed for the whole
of Flanders by the University of Antwerp and KU Leuven, but they also
give cities and towns insight into how traffic evolves year by year in their
territory. The citizen scientists actively contribute to the collection of
this research data: we are definitely talking about citizen science in this

example.

###### What are the underlying motives of citizen science?

The main reason to set up a citizen science initiative is
to research something. Citizen science is a method of
collecting scientific data that offers unique benefits.
Here, for now, we will discuss in general terms the
motivations for engaging in citizen science. In the
next chapter, we will highlight specific benefits for

local governments.

###### Research with more data and in new places
Citizen science can collect or process far more data
with the help of a large group of citizen scientists than
a small group of professional researchers could do
on their own. Just think of large-scale projects like
[Waarnemingen.be, where thousands of observations](https://waarnemingen.be/)
and photos of Belgian plants and animals are added on
[daily base. Or consider the DoeDat platform, where](https://www.doedat.be/)

thousands of volunteers annotate and transcribe

photos and scans on their own computer.

A second advantage of citizen science is that it

can provide access to places, people and insights

that are less easily gauged by traditional methods.
[For example, Mijn Tuinlab was created because](https://mijntuinlab.be/)
researchers wanted to gain insight into the
biodiversity, water permeability and cooling effect
of private gardens, which cover 9% of the surface

in Flanders. In the Amsterdam (the Netherlands)

neighbourhood of Slotermeer, the Dutch National

Institute for Public Health and the Environment

received little response to the health surveys they

organized, until they began working with a diverse
group of Slotermeer residents. They were trained
on the one hand to take questionnaires from
their neighbours and on the other hand to reflect

together with them on what was needed to make the
neighbourhood greener and healthier. (See Chapter
[9 - Healthy Slotermeer)](https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/gezondheid-verbindt-in-amsterdam-slotermeer)

Data collected through citizen science can be
extremely valuable to cities and towns. Citizen
science can be applied in all phases of the policy

cycle. This aspect is discussed in detail in the second
chapter of this manual.


Research is the most important goal of citizen science, but education and
impact are important side effects.

While the acquisition of new data and insights is

central to citizen science, two other goals almost

always come into play: education and impact.

###### Education and awareness

Citizen science projects are by their nature very

educational. Since citizen scientists themselves

get to work with a scientific method, they almost

automatically learn a great deal about science.
They not only learn about the content of what they

are researching, but they also gain insight into the

research process. This way, citizen science can
strengthen the participants’ confidence in the
scientific method, sharpen their critical sense and
raise a barrier against disinformation.

Of course, citizen science projects must invest

heavily in training their citizen scientists. Projects
that fail to do so will most likely see a rapid decline
in the number of participants (who drop out of the
research in frustration), but will also end up with
incorrectly collected or inconsistent data, from which

little valuable insight can be obtained.

-----

###### Social impact
Projects conducting research on topics in the
immediate vicinity of their citizen scientists
often recruit new participants more easily. This
is demonstrated in Flanders by the success of
[mobility measurements such as Straatvinken and](https://straatvinken.be/about-straatvinken/)

[Telraam, and the air quality measurements such as](https://telraam.net/en)

[CurieuzeNeuzen and the Luftdaten initiatives. In](https://2018.curieuzeneuzen.be/vlaanderen-2018/in-english/)

these projects, citizen scientists not only contribute

to a large-scale dataset, but they also gain insight into
traffic and air pollution in their own street

or neighbourhood.

However, this rule does not always hold true,
as is proven by the enormous success of citizen


© An Van Gijsegem

science initiatives with less direct local impact, like

[Zooniverse, VeleHanden or Doedat.](https://www.zooniverse.org/)

Nevertheless, we notice that in addition to these

large-scale projects, a lot of local and relatively

small-scale measurement initiatives are emerging,
often from a local concern. These may be local

[residents that are concerned about the water quality](https://www.waterlandvzw.be/)
[in their rivers and canals, that are bothered by a foul](https://www.waterlandvzw.be/)

[smell or that want to know more about the air quality](https://dnoses.eu/pilots/)

[in their city. With these measurements, citizens](https://influencair.be/)

usually hope to convince authorities to take steps in

addressing these concerns.

-----

###### Requirements and tradeoffs in citizen science

Citizen science has been gaining a lot of interest in
recent years, but we are convinced that a choice for
citizen science must be well-considered and justified.

Citizen science is enormously valuable when applied
in the right way, but the method also requires a lot of
resources and energy. There are several tradeoffs to

be made. There are usually no wrong or right choices,
but it is certainly useful to thoroughly consider the

pros and cons when setting up a citizen science

project.


###### 3


###### Autonomous citizen scientists or rigid protocols?
Allowing citizen scientists to determine when,

where and how to collect or process data, will

motivate them, and it is also very instructive.
This is especially interesting for citizen science

projects in education. This way, students not only
learn something in terms of content, but they
also learn to apply scientific research methods

themselves.

On the other hand, citizen science projects want

to avoid that the collected data contain errors

or are too heterogeneous. They will therefore
aim for an airtight method for data collection

or processing by citizen scientists. However,

excessive restrictions on when, where or in

what way citizen scientists can contribute to

the research, can be less instructive or even

demotivating.

© An Van Gijsegem


###### 2


###### Time and resources

It is sometimes uttered that citizen science is a

cheap way to collect a lot of data, because the

work is done by volunteers. This is a dangerous
misconception. Citizen science initiatives set

up from this rationale, are doomed to fail. The

intensive collaboration with citizen scientists

and various partner organizations requires great
efforts in terms of communication and project

management. These aspects should certainly not

be underestimated when considering a citizen

science project.

###### Sensors: quality or quantity?
Citizen science projects sometimes make use
of sensors or measuring instruments. A project
can choose to invest in a limited number of high

quality and expensive sensors, or it can acquire
a larger number of cheaper sensors. By applying

statistics to a large dataset, less reliable data
from these cheaper but more widely distributed

sensors can still become valuable.


12


-----

###### 4


###### Large numbers of participants, or intense co-creation?

Participation in citizen science is often depicted

as a pyramid. At the bottom in the broad base, a
very large group of citizen scientists perform a

relatively simple and not very time-consuming
task. Take for example installing a sensor or taking
a one-time count of a particular species of animal

or plant.

At the higher stages of the pyramid, citizen

scientists will be more intensely involved in the

project. For example, they will not only contribute

to the data collection or processing, but they

will also be involved in determining the research

question or method, or in communicating the
results. At the very top of the pyramid, we speak

of co-creation, in which citizen scientists and

project staff determine how the project will
proceed on equal footing.

Obviously, the higher up a project is in the
pyramid, the more intensive the involvement of

citizen scientists in the research. This level of

involvement requires a great deal of time and

consultation, and will inevitably be carried out
with a small group of citizen scientists. Projects
at the lower stages of the pyramid, on the other
hand, are able to involve much larger numbers of

volunteers.

## What are the benefits of citizen science for local government?

###### In recent years, citizen science has been gaining both attention among policymakers and recognition among the general public and research institutions. In this chapter we will elaborate on why it is worthwhile for cities and towns to engage in citizen science.


-----

In recent years, citizen science has been gaining both

attention among policymakers and recognition among

the general public and research institutions. In this
chapter we will elaborate on why it is worthwhile for

cities and towns to engage in citizen science.

Additionally, citizen science also contributes to:
_T_ Community building: in citizen science projects,

citizens work together and social cohesion is

strengthened. The communities that emerge in

citizen science projects can be considered as new

associations;


_T_ Network expansion: in citizen science projects,

local government cooperates with knowledge
institutions ((vocational) universities, research

institutions,...), civil society organizations (citizen
movements, associations,...), companies,
and external service providers (communication
agencies, technology companies,...). These new

partnerships enable local government to cooperate

with these parties in other areas as well;

_T_ Media coverage: (the results of) citizen

science projects are often in the spotlight. The

administration’s engagement in these projects
ensures media attention for the local government
and for the theme of the project.

These benefits can be visually presented in three

circles. In a first circle, we see benefits for internal

policymaking (additional data and insights for
policy). The second circle refers to the strengthened

relationship among citizens, and between citizens

and the local government. The third circle concerns

strengthened cooperation between local government

and citizens, and other stakeholders inside and

outside the city limits (knowledge institutions,
social organizations, etc.).

###### Added value 1: collecting new data and insights for policymaking

Through citizen science, a local administration can

gather additional data and insights to substantiate
policymaking. As part of the management and
policy cycle, the Government of Flanders demands

cities and towns to base their multiannual plan on

an environmental analysis and to monitor their

objectives using indicators. Not every theme

has ready-to-use data to comply with these
requirements. Data from citizen science are an

interesting addition to existing data sources and
often provide new knowledge and insights about the

city or town.

In particular, citizen science makes it possible to
gather a lot of data in a short time, to collect more

detailed data, or to collect data that would otherwise

remain hidden. The cost to the city or town is usually

limited as the work is done primarily by volunteers.


We like to illustrate our point about detailed data

collection with two examples:

_T By installing “telramen” (sensors attached_
to windows), both citizens and the local

administration get an in-depth picture of traffic in

a neighbourhood. The end result is more detailed
than a result based on a few counting loops or

cameras installed by the administration;

_T Local data on biodiversity is virtually non-existent._
[Via mijntuinlab.be, citizens and local government](https://mijntuinlab.be)
are able to gauge the fauna and flora at micro level,
right down to private gardens. The evolution of
biodiversity is also valuable policy information.

Citizen science facilitates the movement towards

more data-driven policy. Based on reliable data, the
local government can fully carry out its governing

role: slowing down, stimulating, inspiring, etc. Just
like other data types, results from citizen science
can be used in every phase of the policy cycle, as

explained in the blue box.


16


-----

The results of citizen science can be

used in every phase of the policy cycle.


###### Citizen science in the different phases of the policy cycle


Policy preparation: data from citizen science

projects allow local government to monitor the

changing environment and develop evidence
based dossiers. Some local administrations use

citizen science data in the environmental analysis,

[or use data from Luftdaten to substantiate](https://luftdaten.info/)

project proposals on mobility or climate.

Policymaking: policy decisions can be
(additionally) substantiated by data from citizen

science projects.

###### We want to change the modal split in our city, namely cut car traffic in half and double bike traffic. Using the ‘telramen’ to assess traffic movements in the city, the local government makes informed decisions.” – Interviewed civil servant


Policy implementation: are actions going as
planned? Is the implementation on schedule?

Using citizen science data, a local administration
can assess the status of projects.

###### We look at the CurieuzeNeuzen data multiple times per month, in order to formulate advice.”

– Interviewed civil servant

Policy evaluation: did our actions achieve our
goals? Are we reaching the objectives from our
multiannual plan? Using data from citizen science

projects, a local administration can evaluate its
policy and adjust it if needed. For example, citizen

science projects investigating the heat island
effect are used to monitor the impact of (local)

climate policy.

###### Added value 2: increasing citizen involvement

A second important added value is increased
involvement of citizens in policy and society. Through

citizen science, local government can generate
greater awareness of social issues, make more
effective use of the skills and knowledge of citizens,

and contribute to mutual understanding between

government and citizens.

######  The dialogue with citizens is at least as important as the accuracy of the data (...).” – Interviewed civil servant

Citizen science is a way to generate awareness on

important social themes. Most projects in which
schools participate, explicitly play out this form of

sensitization or education.


######  With the data from CurieuzeNeuzen, citizens approached politicians to divert a bus line in their street. As a result, a bus line was cancelled and the street was repaved.” – Interviewed civil servant

Citizen science can also create a better dialogue and

understanding between citizens and policymakers.

Throughout a citizen science project, both parties
get acquainted with each other’s context. Citizens
feel that they are heard and respected by their
government, if attention is paid to their efforts in
citizen science projects. Conversely, through their

contacts with the administration, citizens gain insight

in the whole context. Local governments have to take

several interests into account when drawing up their

policies.


######  In general, we see an increase in knowledge, awareness and ability to act in schools regarding air quality thanks to the citizen science projects.” – Interviewed civil servant

Furthermore, citizen science can also facilitate

behavioural change. Examples include changing the
way we move or disconnecting rainwater from the

sewage system.

Citizen science is also a form of citizen

empowerment. It helps communities bring certain

needs or concerns into focus, and to the attention

of local government. It is a way of utilizing the
knowledge and skills of citizens, sometimes in areas

where there is limited expertise within the local

administration.

In doing so, citizens set the agenda and stimulate local
authorities to take action. As a result of the findings
of the CurieuzeNeuzen project, a number of local

administrations set up their own network of sensors
to get a deeper understanding of the issue.

###### Do not be caught off guard as a local government
By following up on citizen science projects in
your city or town, you will stay informed and you
will not be confronted with unexpected findings
at the end of projects.

###### Additional added values

In addition to the direct benefits (data collection,

citizen engagement), citizen science also offers other

potential added values.

###### Community building 

Citizen science stimulates encounters and

strengthens social cohesion within and between

communities. In a sense, citizen science communities

are new associations and enrich the socio-cultural

fabric. Citizens use their leisure time in a meaningful
way and obtain a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment

throughout the process.

###### “ Within citizen science projects, citizens listen to each other and learn to understand each other better: ‘Oh, the trucks bother him, he has children and thinks it’s a

– Interviewed civil servant

###### dangerous situation. Developing partnerships
Through citizen science, a local administration

broadens its network. Since most citizen science

projects involve important social organizations and
scientific institutions, the local government broadens
itself as a network organization. Sometimes there


are supralocal authorities or institutions involved like
the Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij (VMM), the Instituut
voor Natuur en Bos (INBO), provincial governments,

... This way, a local administration establishes a better
intergovernmental dynamic with other levels of

government.

Via citizen science projects, the local government
also builds relationships with (vocational)

universities, Flemish administrations, Flemish

research institutions (VITO, INBO, VLIZ,….), etc.

These connections undoubtedly lead to interesting

win-win situations in other fields. This network

approach is consistent with the growing awareness

among administrations that they are no longer able to

provide answers to complex social problems on their

own. Partnerships are necessary to tackle complex
problems effectively.

## How to start with citizen science as a local government?

###### As a local government engaging in citizen science, you have to appoint responsibilities, determine what you will (not) prioritize, which kind of support you will offer, which conditions you will set in partnerships, etc. In this chapter, we will outline a ten-step roadmap for developing a citizen science policy.

As a local government engaging in citizen science, you

have to appoint responsibilities, determine what you
will (not) prioritize, which kind of support you will offer,

which conditions you will set in partnerships, etc. In
this chapter, we will outline a ten-step roadmap for

developing a citizen science policy.

Lots of cities and towns start with citizen science in

an organic way: motivating citizens to participate
in CurieuzeNeuzen, organizing a traffic count with
Telraam, etc. This is an easy way to get familiarized


with citizen science, but sooner or later key questions
will arise about the role of the government or the
extent of support for citizen science initiatives.

In this chapter, we will outline a ten-step roadmap
for developing a citizen science policy, fully involving
internal and external stakeholders. The steps follow a

logical order, though this order is not predetermined.
Some steps can come sooner or later in the process,
depending on the specific context and the role of the

local government.

###### Step 1: Appoint responsibilities within the local government and create a support base

Citizen science is a new theme and local

administrations in Flanders are still relatively
unacquainted with it. Therefore, the first question

is: who will get the ball rolling within the local
government?

We need process owners and ambassadors on two

levels: on the general organization level, and on
different department levels of the city or town.

_T_ On the general organizational level, the 
responsibility for citizen science is preferably

appointed both administratively and politically. We
have learnt from experience that citizen science is

usually appointed to:

    - the staff member and alderman responsible
for data and analysis;

    - the staff member and alderman responsible

for participation.

Appointing this responsibility will ensure that
there is a point of contact, and that you maintain an

overview on the general organizational level: which

initiatives are being undertaken within the city

limits; how are data stored, etc.

_T_ It is also recommended that every department 
considers the possibilities of citizen science

in their respective policy domains. Ideally, the
actual involvement of the city or town to a citizen

science project lies within the department that is

responsible for that theme. The traffic department

could be involved in a citizen science project on

mobility, while the environmental department
could follow up a project on air quality.

If a local government is involved in multiple and

complex projects, you could consider organising a

working group on the general organizational level or

the project level.


###### Creating support for a citizen science policy within a local government

_T_ Involve different city departments when
developing a vision and strategy. Consult

at regular intervals external stakeholders
(knowledge institutions, citizen science
initiatives, schools, social organizations).

_T_ Inspire staff members from different
departments with good practices from this
manual and/or from your own experience.

_T_ Test initiatives, start with easy projects
(limited duration, limited investment).

_T_ Communicate about citizen science, both to

the political level and to the civil servants.
Use examples and highlight real-life
applications for your organization.

###### Step 2: Identify citizen science initiatives and stakeholders

A survey among local governments shows that cities

and towns generally have little insight into citizen

science initiatives in their territory. Develop your

citizen science policy, starting with a good inventory.
Do not simply compose a list of completed, ongoing

and planned projects within your city or town, but get

to know the citizens and organizations involved, and

ask about their plans, motivations, needs, etc.


In this introductory phase, you could consider

organizing a meeting with all citizen science

initiatives. This way, you get to know the initiatives

better and you make clear that you value and hear the

people behind the initiatives. Please note that not all

citizen science initiatives will consider themselves

as a citizen science project, e.g., local nature guides
who keep track of certain animal species, local history

societies, volunteers at archaeological excavations,

etc.

© Mieke Sterken


You do not develop a citizen science policy on your
own. You work together with employees from
different departments, and you report to the city

council, just like you would do with other actions

and goals. It is important not to rush into this. Think
carefully about how you approach and organize the
development of your policy.

Develop a concrete project plan to introduce citizen

science within your local government. In this plan, you

should include among others:

_T the steps you want to take. You can use our_
ten-step proposal as a basis;

_T the results you want to achieve. The end result_
is an organization-wide vision and perhaps one

or two concrete applications. Also determine


intermediate steps, such as the development
of an opportunity map that summarizes the
opportunities of citizen science for your local
government (see chapter 2), a framework of
agreements for dealing with data (see chapter 6),

etc.;

_T_ the people you want to involve (see chapter 5).

As the person in charge, you can launch the plan
yourself, but you should quickly involve colleagues
from various departments in the process and
form a small core group of enthusiasts. Together,
you can reflect more deeply on the roles the local
government will undertake, and on the forms
of support (see step 6). Also provide one or two

review moments in the trajectory with citizens,

citizen science initiatives, schools and other

stakeholders committed to citizen science;

_T_ the timeframe you have in mind.


###### Step 4: Identify opportunities of citizen science for the local government

Creating a support base for citizen science
(mentioned at step 1) is an ongoing process. It also
implies identifying the concrete added values for
the local government. If co-workers and managers

see the advantages, you will motivate them more
easily. Organize an interactive workshop on the
subject with colleagues from various departments,

and give attention to every domain. Environment or
mobility are well-known themes for citizen science,

but there are also interesting applications in culture,
sports, health, welfare or public domain. Consider, for

example:


_T constructing the history of a town, based on_
photographs which citizens submit, classify and

describe;

_T collaborating with citizens to identify littered_
areas, analyse their characteristics and organize

actions;

_T_ identifying and analysing gaps in social services.


Citizen science does not always have to involve (new)
data collection. You can also further analyse existing
data, or organize discussion groups on the findings.

Identifying concrete opportunities does not imply
that the local government itself has to take initiative.

We strongly believe in embracing and encouraging

bottom-up initiatives.

© Mieke Sterken

-----

###### Specifying added value for the local government during an interactive workshop 
Organize a workshop with employees of various departments to
identify concrete opportunities. Provide several tables (or online:
break-out rooms) in which the following questions are discussed:

_T_ which information needs are currently insufficiently met? Which
trends or evolutions are underexplored?

_T In which domains can citizen science involve citizens more_

strongly and/or raise awareness?

Let pairs brainstorm on post-its and rank them using the COCD box
(see below). You can get to work immediately with the ‘wow ideas’ in

the light blue quadrant.


The results of this exercise can be summarized in a persuasive

opportunity map, that illustrates how citizen science brings added

value to the local government.

###### What about spontaneous bottom-up initiatives?
Keep in mind that citizen science initiatives often emerge from
society and are not often considered promising at first by the local

government. In some cases, they will be in line with the ambitions
of the administration, in other cases they will not. Sometimes they

will seek contact with the local government themselves, in other
cases they may want to keep a certain distance. The attitude of
the local government or the degree of cooperation depends on the

relevance and its possibilities, but in principle you should maintain

an open attitude towards citizen initiatives.

###### Step 5: Determine the roles of the local government

A city or town can be involved in citizen science in
different ways. We distinguish seven different roles
that in practice are often intertwined. A city can be a

regulator, a partner in one project and a promoter in

another project at the same time.

The choice of role of the administration is related

to the importance it gives to citizen science. The
position of the government can change across
legislatures. Furthermore, the role of the government
also depends on current events, for example if there
is bottom-up pressure regarding the construction of
a new ring road or a traffic accident. These events can

lead you to switch to a more active role. Regardless
of the role chosen, it is important that the entire
administration is well informed. This way, everyone

knows where the support or responsibility starts or

stops, when you are approached by a citizen science

initiative.

When considering these roles, we recommend an

interactive work session with a smaller core group
of colleagues. In doing so, you take into account the
capacity and resources of the local government.

The very active roles also require the necessary

personnel.


###### 3


a dialogue with citizen scientists, the government

may also succeed in aligning the research with its

own expectations and agenda.

###### Initiator: in this role, the local government itself initiates a citizen science initiative. This can be a new initiative, but one can also tap into an existing initiative and roll it out more broadly within the city or town. For example:


######  We contacted Telraam - there are a number of streets whose traffic we want to assess, for the purpose of the mobility plan. We purchased and distributed about 50 ‘telramen’. Next week, there will be a call to recruit another 40 residents in the suburbs.” 

– Interviewed civil servant


###### Coordinator: the city or town is in charge of the project coordination of a citizen science project. Evidently, this does not mean that the administration has to do everything, because then it would no longer be citizen science. In its role as coordinator, the administration maintains a bird’s eye view on the project, maintains the network and the cooperation, and ensures that the intended results are achieved Partner: the government is an active partner in a citizen science project Broker: in this role, the government brings parties together and facilitates citizen science communities. Promoter: as a promoter, the government supports and encourages citizen science initiatives through grants, logistics (communication, infrastructure), staff deployment, etc. The different forms of possible support are described in the next step.


###### 2


###### Regulator: this role sets out the rules for citizen science activities, for example, deciding where sensors can be placed in public spaces, any rules that must be observed in terms of traffic safety, etc Listener: citizen science initiatives often arise

from a concern in society. Groups collect data to

make their concerns evidence-based (‘to measure

is to know’). Even if the project goal, the data or
the research method do not entirely fit the policy
agenda of the local government, it is important

that these initiatives are not ignored. By entering

### 6


###### Step 6: Determine which types of support the government will offer

A city or town can support citizen science projects in
different ways. This choice depends on the vision and
possibilities of the local government. It is important

to make choices beforehand, and to communicate

consistently, both internally and externally.


communication. Moreover, communication involves

more than printed media and online communication.

It also concerns organizing contact moments or

developing targeted communication through

advisory boards.

###### “ The participation officer helped with the recruitment of volunteers. He used the city’s online participation platform for this. A lot of citizens are registered there, so there has

– Interviewed civil servant
###### been a lot of response.” Logistics
Local governments can also facilitate financially
in the purchase of equipment, for example sensors
or do-it-yourself kits for sensors. In the case of
‘Telraam’, for example, we see that this is often the
case. The financial resources usually come from the
budgets of the departments involved, for example the
mobility department when it comes to traffic safety.
During discussions, there was an idea of a lending
post or library for measuring instruments, although
we have not yet found any concrete examples.

###### Personnel support

It is not uncommon for civil servants to lend a

hand in citizen science projects. Current examples of

personnel support include:

_T_ management of a citizen science project;

_T_ participation in meetings and thinking along

with the initiators and participants of the citizen

science projects;
_T_ making personnel available for various tasks within

the citizen science projects: collecting samples,

maintenance of sensors, communication, etc.


###### Expectation management is important
When a local government lends its support

or cooperation to a citizen science project,

citizen scientists often consider this to be a

‘commitment for change’. The local government
must be careful not to create expectations

among citizen scientists that it cannot
meet. Therefore, communicate clearly about

which commitments you can make as a local
government and which you cannot, in terms of

project support, but certainly also in relation to
the results and findings of the projects.

Also be open about the possibilities and the

time needed to turn research results into policy

and actual changes in the city.


###### Supporting communication
In terms of communication, a city or town can
provide real added value for citizen science projects.
Think of announcements for recruiting participants,

announcing results or celebrating an initiative.
In a survey conducted for this roadmap, citizen

science initiatives indicated that they particularly
appreciate the governmental support in the area of


28


-----

###### Community building
The local government can also help create

citizen science partnerships. The government can

bring together knowledge institutions, civil society

organizations, companies and citizens, or citizens

themselves. The administration can use the broad

network of organizations with which it is involved.
We give a number of examples of this brokerage role

below:

_T_ The city of Bruges has a Facebook group on the

theme of climate. By regularly posting relevant

news and calls, the city builds a community

committed to this theme. For citizen science

projects on climate, volunteers can be recruited

within this group.
_T_ The city of Genk has, in the context of Stiemerlab,

approached local associations (e.g., sports clubs)
to participate. This has led to the introduction of
a lot of new faces who perhaps would not quickly

participate on their own.
_T_ In the city of Ghent, the district director of the

Meulestede - De Muide neighborhood motivated
and brought together residents to count traffic on

the Muide bridge.

###### Financial support
A local government can directly or indirectly

facilitate the search for financial resources for citizen

science projects:
_T_ by helping citizen science initiatives to find

financial resources: identify grant opportunities,
and if necessary, support the development of grant

applications;
_T_ by launching a grant for citizen science initiatives

or by opening up existing grants to citizen
science projects. Examples are the subsidies for
neighbourhood projects in Ghent (Wijkbudget) or
the thematic call for subsidies for climate projects


© Mieke Sterken

in Mechelen. In both cases, these calls are also

open to citizen science.

Local funding can certainly make a significant
difference for small and local initiatives. Large citizen
science projects, often launched by an academic
institution, are more likely to aim for supralocal
funding and larger grants.

Just about all projects - large or small - indicate that
funding does not account for long term projects.
Usually, funding channels are temporarily accessible,

while initiatives often have the ambition to collect

data over a longer period of time.


###### Managing, analysing and disseminating data
Depending on the capacity and knowledge within the

local government, the city can also support citizen
science projects that do not have knowledge of, or

partners in data collection and analysis. In some cases,

local governments turn to an external service provider.


###### Should you, as a local government, support every citizen science initiative? 
As a government, you don’t have to support

every citizen science initiative. With an open
attitude and respect for citizen initiatives,

you are already taking an important step. As
a government, you can also refer to other

partners. Initiatives that you support as an

administration should first and foremost fit

in with your own ambitions and the current

multiannual plan. Make your needs known as a

local government; this could lead to the joint
development of a new project.


29


-----

### 7


Requirements from the local government

can relate to:

_T the quality of data and measurements. Both_
objective (measurements) and subjective
(opinions) data must be collected in a substantiated
way. Therefore, you could offer citizen scientists
professional training;

_T_ making data available to the government and
making data publicly available (open source);
_T_ the openness of the citizen science initiative

to all citizens.

###### Step 7: Determine requirements and standards

If the local administration participates in, or supports

a citizen science project, it can also formulate

boundary conditions. This is certainly a legitimate
demand, if there is a strong commitment from the

administration. At the same time, the administration

should always be aware of the fact that they are

dealing with voluntary initiatives that should not be

deterred by excessively high requirements.

###### Step 8: Consolidate and communicate your local citizen science policy

When a local government has completely determined

how it wants to deal with citizen science in the

coming years, it is time to summarize the vision
in a document. This will provide guidance for

stakeholders.

Publish the vision on the local government’s website,

so citizens and associations can take note of it.


###### What comes first: vision or practice?
In an ideal world, a vision precedes concrete

actions. However, this sets a high bar and

threshold. You can also get involved with citizen
science from a bottom-up approach, through

concrete projects and collaborations. This way,

a vision can gradually emerge, based on insights
from experiences.

###### Step 10: Evaluate the policy periodically

Like any policy plan, a citizen science policy is
never finished. Over the years, needs change, new
opportunities arise and we learn from experience.

Periodically re-examine the vision on citizen science

and make adjustments. Also involve citizen scientists

in this evaluation.

## A roadmap for a citizen science project

###### In this chapter, you will find a step-by-step plan to get started with a citizen science project. The roadmap covers activities before, during and after setting up (your own) initiatives. Before starting a project using this roadmap, it is recommended that the local government already has a vision and policy on citizen science.


-----

In this chapter, you will find a step-by-step plan to get

started with a citizen science project. The roadmap
covers activities before, during and after setting
up (your own) initiatives. Before starting a project

using this roadmap, it is recommended that the local

government already has a vision and policy on

citizen science.

###### How to use this roadmap

This roadmap provides a detailed overview of all

activities involved in setting up and carrying out a
citizen science project. It provides a manual for the
project from inception to finalization. Depending
on the role of the local government as well as the

project’s objective, you will go through this step-bystep plan in a different way.

###### The role of the local government
The role(s) that you as a local government wish to take
(see chapter 3), determines how you will go through
this step-by-step plan. If you as a local government
are the ‘initiator’ of a project, you will take the lead in

several activities. In more passive roles, such as ‘the

broker’ or ‘the regulator’, you will be involved in one or

a limited number of activities. Also, as the initiator of a

project, you do not have to bear full responsibility for
all activities: after all, citizen science is something you

do together with others.

Furthermore, as a local government you can also

choose to outsource certain activities to external

providers, such as consultants, or you can assign

them to project partners. This can be a suitable
solution for local governments that do not have
sufficient in-house capacity or resources.


If a citizen science project is started by citizens or a

citizens’ association, the local government may play a

limited role, or it may even not be involved at all. Then,
it is mainly a matter of finding out in which phase(s)

the local government can set up a cooperation and
possibly offer support. Have a look at the internal
vision statement on citizen science of your local
government (see chapter 3). This vision paper helps
to define the role and form of support of a local

government within a citizen science project.

###### The project’s objective
The extent to which you follow this roadmap also
depends on the project’s objective (see Chapter 1).
For a project that focuses primarily on data collection,
the focus will be on the first phases of the project.
If there is more emphasis on raising awareness, the
focus will lie in the last phases of the project.

You can also use this roadmap to set up a small-scale

project or experiment. Such a small-scale project
can serve as a pilot study for a larger citizen science
project in the future.

and we also recommend that you perform an internal
check (see chapter 3). Is there support within the local
government for developing the problem statement?
Which departments should be involved?

-----

###### Step 2: Is citizen science a suitable method?
In this step, you consider whether a citizen science
approach fits your problem statement. It may well
be that citizen science does not fit your problem

statement at all, and that other methods of data

collection (such as databases or questionnaires)
or participatory methods (such as citizen panels or
discussion forums) may lead to better results. There
are a number of rules of thumb that can help you make

this choice.

First of all, you will choose a citizen science project if

you want to support research and participation. A
powerful way to achieve this is by having citizens play

an active role. Initiatives can be set up by citizens or

a citizens’ association themselves, or you let citizens
actively participate in your project. An active way of
participation, for example collecting ideas or data,

will strengthen involvement in a particular topic.
Building a dense network of sensors with the help of

citizens is also possible. Make sure that citizens do

not only place a sensor, but are also actively involved

in the whole process, so that they also know why

you are doing this. This way, citizen science acts as a

participatory method to engage citizens.

A second important rule of thumb is the complexity
of the data protocol. A data protocol defines the way

participants are asked to collect data. How much

time does it take for a participant to collect data? Is

training required? The easier it is to participate, the
better a citizen science approach will fit. Research
shows that user-friendly data protocols that were
applied to a large group of participants are more likely
to be used for policymaking [2]. Thus, the more data
that is collected in a simple way, the more it benefits

both the local government and the participants.

Additionally, there are some other questions that can

help you decide whether or not to engage in citizen
science [3]. Answers at the right end of the spectrum
justify a citizen science approach:


Do you have a clear and
well-defined goal in mind?

Clear research
Rather a vague idea
question

Can you engage citizens in a meaningful way?


One-way

communication


Engagement
is important


How many participants do you
need to reach your goal?

Few participants Many participants

How user-friendly is the data protocol?

Complex Simple

Do you have sufficient resources
to support participants?

No resources Many resources

How clear are the motivations for participation?

No clear
Clear motivations
motivations

Using these questions and tips, a local government

can also give advice to citizens or citizen associations

on whether or not to adopt a citizen science approach

to the formulated problem statement.

###### Phase 1: Define

If citizen science fits as a method for your problem
statement, then start by defining the first building
blocks of your project.

###### Step 3: Define the project objectives
Citizen science projects generally aim for three
different objectives (see Chapter 1). Link these
objectives to your problem statement (see Step 1):


###### Objectives for a citizen science project
_T_ contribute to research: collecting data;

_T_ educate and raise awareness: increasing

knowledge about a particular theme or issue,

increasing understanding and support;

_T_ create social impact: strong locally embedded

projects in which people seek a solution to

social issues.


Consider carefully which outcome(s) you are aiming
for as a local government. You can combine several

objectives, or have one primary objective. For
example: if you choose to collect data, you also need

to decide whether you are actually going to use,

change or prove something with the data. You may
choose, as your primary objective, to focus mainly

on data collection and less or not at all on social

impact. Of course, you can combine both objectives,

this being the most ideal scenario. It is important

that you clearly communicate these objectives to

the participants: is it an experiment, a short-term
intervention, or inspiration for a better city or town in
the long run?

It is possible that the project’s objective is already

determined by the citizen science initiative and that
it does not fit with the policy agenda of the local

administration. In that case, you can try to enter a
dialogue and align the research. If the objective is not
yet defined, then you can link it to policy plans, your

organization or policy issues.


The local government may also recognize the
importance of taking on a new challenge that
presents itself through the citizen science initiative.

In order to further shape your project objective, you

can create a use case. A use case describes what you

as a local government actually want to achieve with

the project.

######  As a city you have to present a valuable use case to your citizens. Why are we investigating? What do we want to know? What are the measures? Is it for climate, health? For what age group? Why should the public be concerned about this? You have to have a cause and an approach.”

###### Step 4: Find resources or funds
After defining the project objectives, you make a
financial estimate of the project.

Via citizen science, you can collect a lot of research
data in a short period of time. However, citizen
science is not free of charge. The total cost will

depend to a great extent on what role you take on

as a local government, what costs your partners will
finance and what type of support you will provide.
This includes both staffing costs and material costs.

Depending on the estimate, you may want to seek an
external source of funding. Most costs will be made
in the development phase of your project. Also keep

in mind that the cost of a citizen science project
will increase proportionally with the number of

participants.

Citizen science initiatives may also ask a local
government for financial support for their project.

In this role as “promoter”, you can provide material
support, for example by making meeting rooms
available, or personnel support, for example in

promoting the project. As a local government, you

can also support a project through a grant.

More information about financing citizen science can
be found in chapter 7.


39


-----

###### Step 5: Assemble the project team
Citizen science is about working together. In this step,

you determine who is going to do what exactly. Will

you take on a responsibility as a local government
yourself? When is it better to outsource? Who are you
going to outsource to? Or will you rather bring parties
together?

Constituting a project team can be done on the basis
of time management and expertise.

If you as a local government are the initiator of the

project, then it is important to compose a balanced

team. As initiator, it is your job to determine what
competencies are needed for the project to be

successful. You can find these competencies

internally in the local government, outsource to an

external service provider, or choose a project partner.

The activities with the most impact on the project
results are best part of a shared responsibility or

taken on by you as a local government. For example,
formulating a problem statement or project


objectives can be done in consultation with civil

society. This way, you immediately set up a project

in a co-creative manner. It is better to choose one

person responsible for sharing data and following

guidelines on privacy and ethics. When choosing

the project team, you should also consider involving

neutral partners. For example, knowledge or research
institutions can be of added value in developing the

data protocol and analysing data. They have the
expertise and can analyse the results in a scientific

way. This also generates public trust.

If you as a local government take on a ‘broker’ role,
then you can propose a number of organizations that
can be part of the project. You pass on a number of

contacts to the citizen science initiative, and you

could even introduce these parties to each other.
Here, the government takes on a facilitating role by
bringing different parties together.

Chapter 5 discusses collaborations in citizen science

projects in more detail.

###### Step 6: Identify your participants and get to know them
Do you want to reach the general public, active

citizen scientists, passively involved sympathizers,

people that would like to think constructively about
a topic, or niche experts? The better you define the

target group, the better you will be able to assess
how to collaborate effectively. Citizen scientists have

their own motivations and aspirations. Not knowing

your potential target group and not knowing how to
stimulate that group is a potential pitfall in citizen

science.

It is therefore important to list your target groups
and think about their profile and possible level of

involvement in the project:

_T_ Primary target groups: a primary target group

consists of people who will be most involved in
your project, and for whom your project objective

has the greatest impact. This is the target group

that will contribute the most to your project.
_T_ Secondary target groups: a secondary target

group refers to the people who will be informed

about your project, but who are not directly
involved. This can change in a later phase of the

project, when a secondary target group becomes a

primary target group.

_T_ Intermediary target groups: an intermediary

target group is a group or person through which

you can communicate about your project.

Local governments can play an important role in
defining and bringing communities together, without

actively contributing to the project. In the “broker”
role, you then focus primarily on bringing parties

together.

###### Step 7: Take into account privacy and ethics
Citizen science can pose challenges in terms of
privacy and ethics. The Citizen Science Data Charter
includes a number of guidelines on privacy and ethics:
_T Pay active attention to privacy and ensure_
knowledge sharing: provide a basic information kit

about privacy, rights and obligations, and integrity

in data processing. Designate a data manager.
_T Comply with the GDPR guidelines._
_T Communicate clearly about intellectual property_
and copyrights: do so for the data collection and

dissemination of the results.

_T Carefully trade off your data quality and quantity_
against ethics, feasibility and project objectives.
_T Watch out for undesirable ethical side effects when_
releasing your data.
_T Adopt a respectful, equal attitude toward citizen_
scientists.

If you as a local government are an initiator or partner
in the project, you will follow up on these guidelines.

In more passive roles, such as the regulator, you may

advise and pass these guidelines on to citizen science

initiatives.

science privacy and ethics guidelines.

###### Phase 2: Develop

In this phase of the citizen science project, you make
all preparations before the project kicks off.

###### Step 8: Determine the data protocol
In this step you determine the data protocol, this

is the way participants collect data. To determine
the data protocol, you will consider the following

questions:
_T What type of data do you need? Does it involve_
objective or subjective measurements? Do you
focus on one or more parameters?
_T Does it involve creating a new dataset or adding to_
an existing dataset?
_T What is the geographical and temporal scope of the_
project?
_T Do you need a representative sample?_
_T How will participants have to collect the data: via_
one or several measuring instruments?

In general, it is best to develop a simple data protocol.

The easier participants can collect data, the more

likely you will collect qualitative data over time.

42


© Mieke Sterken

If the data protocol is too difficult, participants might

drop out quickly or you might exclude certain groups.

As a local government, you can also let experts, such

as informed citizens or scientists, determine the data

protocol. It can also be a shared responsibility in the
implementation of a project.


-----

###### Step 9: Determine data requirements
When determining the data requirements, you
consider the following questions:
_T How do I obtain reliable data?_
_T What are possible mistakes that_
participants can make?
_T What are possible validation mechanisms?_
_T What are possible verification mechanisms?_
_T Who is responsible for data management within_
the team?

_T How will I store data, analyse it and make it_
accessible?

We recommend writing down the answers to these
questions in a data management plan (DMP). In the
DMP, you describe how you ensure - during and after
completion of a project - that all data have a reliable

quality, are stored securely and are made optimally

findable, accessible, reusable and linkable. We

recommend having the DMP prepared by a permanent


project partner. This will usually be the partner who will

physically store and manage the data.

Chapter 6 goes more into detail on how to obtain

reliable data. Further, there is also the Citizen Science

Data Charter for setting up a DMP for a citizen science

project.voor een citizen-scienceproject.


###### Verification in the “Oog voor Diabetes” project 
[In the “Oog voor Diabetes” (Eye for Diabetes)](https://www.oogvoordiabetes.be/)

project, citizens annotate abnormalities on retinal
images. In doing so, they help build a reference
database of annotated images that can be used to

train an intelligent computer model to eventually
recognize diabetic retinopathy by itself. As a builtin verification mechanism, each retinal image is
analysed ten times by different citizen scientists,

so that errors can be averaged out easily.

-----

###### Step 10: Determine technological requirements
In addition to determining the data requirements, you

also have to consider the technological requirements
of your measuring instruments. The following

questions can help:
_T Am I going to use a mobile application_
to collect data?

_T Am I going to use open-source software or develop_
something myself?
_T Am I going to use a web-based technology?_
_T Am I going to connect with citizen scientists online_
and how am I going to set this up?
_T Am I going to bundle all content on one project_
website?

_T What sensors will I choose? Where will I install these?_
_T Do I distribute off-the-shelf sensors, have_
participants build their own, or distribute a pre
made sensor kit?

_T Would I like to share the results on a public display_
in my city or town?

Local governments are often approached by citizen

science projects to discuss certain technological

requirements. Usually, this concerns location
determination of sensors and permission to install

them. In the ‘regulator’ role, the government can

determine where sensors will be placed in the public

space and provide staff to install them. You can also

give advice on which measuring instruments to
choose, if you would like to use certain data yourself
for formulating policy actions.

When choosing measuring instruments, it is
important to consider a number of factors.


© An Van Gijsegem

First and foremost, there are the lifetime and quality
of the measuring instruments to consider. Low-cost

sensors can be purchased in large quantities. For
example, an air quality sensor from Luftdaten costs
about 50 euros. However, the lifetime and quality of

these measuring instruments are not that good. Be

transparent about this to participants and colleagues

within the local government. Explain that the data
come with a certain margin of error and that after a
number of years the sensor will no longer measure as

well as it did at the start.

Furthermore, it is also important to match the

measuring instruments to the target group. A choice
for a certain technology will always implicitly appeal

to a certain target group. For example, sensors in
a do-it-yourself kit will appeal to a more technical

audience. Make sure you do not exclude certain

groups. Possible solutions are providing guidance,
giving sensors on loan and/or working with a socially

favorable rate.


###### Muide Meulestede Morgen
Measuring instruments do not have to be
high-tech. You can just as easily collect traffic
data using only pen and paper. This method of

pegging was applied in the ‘Muide [Muilestede](https://stad.gent/nl/muide-meulestede-morgen)

[Morgen’ project. This urban renewal project](https://stad.gent/nl/muide-meulestede-morgen)
has an eye for sustainable mobility. A number of

residents raised the issue of the excess amount

of through traffic at the Muidepoort.


44


-----

###### Step 11: Develop support materials
In this step, we emphasize providing support
materials for citizen scientists. Who can they turn
to with their questions? Who will answer these
questions and in what timeframe? Make sure you have
[a general info@yourcitizenscienceproject.com address](mailto:info%40yourcitizenscienceproject.com?subject=)
to handle incoming questions from participants.

Appoint a person to centralize these questions and
gather all necessary information from the different

project partners.

Participants in your citizen science project need good

support to carry out the data collection or analysis
correctly. There are a number of possibilities:
_T Video clips_
_T Step-by-step instruction manuals_
_T A list of frequently asked questions_
_T Training workshops_
_T Organizing a webinar with the opportunity to ask_
questions to an expert. This can also motivate

participants who want to gain more in-depth

knowledge on the topic.
_T “Train the trainer” modules: you provide training_
to a number of participants in your project,

who in turn will help other participants. This is a
(cost-)efficient way to support a large group of

participants.

This responsibility is best taken on by a partner

who has the necessary expertise and capacity

to continuously support participants. As a local

authority, you can also work with ambassadors.


###### Step 12: Develop a communication and engagement plan
Communication is an essential component of citizen

science. This is how you recruit, engage and motivate
participants. Communication is also necessary to

disseminate the results of the research or to raise

awareness among the general public. You should not

underestimate the time invested in communication

with the citizens involved and to the general public.
It has become something of a cliché that 90% of

your time in a citizen science project is attributed to

communication.

In your communication plan, you can consider
(public) moments when you communicate about the

project. In addition to a launch event organized by the

local government, you can also attract some media
attention during and after the project.

###### Step 13: Conduct a pilot test
This activity is not a necessary step in your project,
but it is definitely recommended. Before you launch

and promote the project, test all materials with a
small group of participants, preferably co-workers,
friends or acquaintances for whom it is okay to make a

mistake.

You will test the entire course of the project: do the

participants understand the project objectives? Do
they know where to find the measuring instruments?
Do the collected data end up on the server?

Evaluate with the project team and adjust if

necessary.


###### An ambassador for your project 
[In the project “Luchtpijp”, the organization](https://www.luchtpijp.be/)

Beweging.net works with volunteers to build

sensor kits. The volunteers put these kits

together and think about how the sensor can

be optimized. These volunteers have become
ambassadors of the project. They help other

participants with technical problems with their

sensor. For example, they go to people’s homes

to provide on-site support.

###### Phase 3: Launch

In this phase, you launch the project to the general

public. This is the phase where data are collected

and you generate and maintain engagement with

participants.

###### Step 14: Promote and publicize your project
In this step, you launch and promote the project to

the general public. The prepared communication
and engagement plan, in which you identified target

groups and communication channels, will now be

carried out.

The local government can take charge of the launch
and promotion of a citizen science project, if it is
the initiator of the project. If you do not have the

resources or capabilities to do so, you can outsource

this step to a project partner or service provider such

as a communications agency.

However, a local government is ideally placed to

create initial outreach. You can use the regular

communication channels to promote the project,
such as the website of the city or town. Furthermore,
‘stadswachters’ can flyer and you can launch a call

through a city magazine or district newspaper,


social media, digital screens, etc. The local

government can also make targeted contact with
associations to address specific profiles, such as

youth clubs or social services. Knowledge institutions
and bottom-up initiatives often turn to local
governments for this type of communicative support.

In order to facilitate continuous participation of

citizens and manage the community, we recommend

working through organized groups and networks.
Consider, for example, a civic association or network,

or a university’s science communication department.

These organizations have the necessary expertise to

connect with participants on a regular basis.

-----

###### Step 15: Receive data and provide feedback
Once you launched your project, participants will get

to work. This is when data or metrics are collected

and submitted. Monitor the chosen measuring
instruments, and regularly check for technical
problems in receiving the data. At this stage of the

project, you will also hand out support materials.

Share instructional videos or make sure someone is

available to answer questions.

In addition to monitoring the incoming data, you
can also monitor the number of participants. How

many participants are registered? How many times
has a mobile application been downloaded? If you

are working with sensors, you can also check how

many sensors have been distributed and how many

sensors are actually connected to the network and
the platform. If you notice a drop in the number of
participants or amount of data submitted, additional

recruitment may be required.

Also make sure that, at this stage, you are able to
provide quick feedback. This will help motivate
participants. If you will be working with data

submissions, you can send out an automated thankyou email. For more extensive feedback, you can

use a recurring newsletter or intermediate physical
meetings. When giving feedback, do not make too
much use of personal communication, but bundle

your messages and communicate through generic

channels.

###### Step 16: Communicate and maintain engagement
In line with the previous activity, in this step you

think about maintaining high involvement among
participants. This is one of the main difficulties in

a citizen science project: how do you ensure that

participants do not drop out and that they stay
involved in the long run?

Be aware that the number of participants who drop
out is highest at the first contact with the project,
or just after. The reasons why they choose not to

participate anymore, are diverse, such as too much

jargon used, a complex data protocol, but also a
perceived lack of appreciation or openness about

the results. To keep participants involved in the
long run, it is important to regularly give a token of

appreciation:


######  Provide appreciation: pastry or a reception, a thank-you email, or

– Interviewed civil servant

###### a goodie bag.  As a thank you, there was an excursion to the Netherlands, where there was a partner meeting with a dinner. The participants enjoyed talking to locals about water measurements.” – Quote from a citizen science initiative

###### Phase 4: Analyse

In this phase of the project, you analyse the

collected data

###### Step 17: Analyse and interpret the data
The tasks of the city or town in this activity depends
very much on the project and on the chosen role. If

a project was not initiated by the local government,
it obviously does not have to be responsible for

the interpretation or conclusions. However, it is
important to be involved in the analysis phase, if the

local administration wants to draw conclusions for

policy.

Data analysis and interpretation are best carried

out in cooperation with knowledge institutions

and citizens. A knowledge institution has the
necessary experience in scientific data analysis and

interpretation, and they give legitimacy to the results.

By involving citizens, you increase co-ownership,

ensure that the interpretation is not too one-sided,
and generate broad support for the conclusions.

Analysing and interpreting data together can also
facilitate a healthy dialogue and corresponding

visions.

######  Having a scientific partner, or a citizens’ association linked to a knowledge institution is crucial. We don’t have the in-house knowledge to carry out the interpretation of the data, to determine the data structure or to draw scientific conclusions. It is not in the DNA of a city to carry out these tasks. But this is the good thing about citizen science projects: you have to do it together with other parties. You can’t do it alone: it’s a quadruple helix model.”

When analysing and interpreting data, you need to
take the following aspects into consideration:


_T How reliable is the data? Is it necessary to clean up_
the data?

_T How do we visualize the results? Do we use a_
dashboard, graphs, infographics, etc.?
_T Is there qualitative feedback we should take into_
account?


###### Verrijk de kijk op Brugge
In the citizen science project ‘Verrijk de kijk op
Brugge’ (Enrich your view of Bruges), participants help to describe images from the city

archives, the public library and ‘Musea Brugge’.

Participants are asked to look at the images and

describe what they see. Which people can you
identify? What buildings do you recognize? Do
you recognize Bruges or a borough? Participants complete an instructional form and then
transmit the information to the registrars. The
finalized information is shared through

[this website.](https://erfgoedbrugge.be/)


###### Step 18: Report the results
In this step, you communicate the research results.

You share the results with your primary and

secondary target groups, as well as relevant partners

and the political administration. We recommend

presenting the results tailored to the target group.
You can opt for a more accessible infographic for

the general public, while an in-depth report can be
sent to a more professional audience. You can also

disseminate the results through the press, or through

a personal contact moment with the participants.
This offers an additional opportunity for dialogue

and discussion about the results. You also share

the results internally with other departments and

the political administration. This communication

must include a clear outcome, so that the resources

invested are justified.

Reporting the results is an important communication
milestone in your project. If your project has no
follow-up, this will in most cases be the last physical
(or online) contact moment with the participants.


48


-----

###### Step 19: Share your data
After analysis and interpretation, you can start
sharing your data. This is a key trademark of a citizen

science project. The data and metadata are made
publicly available and the results, if possible, are
published in open access. Sharing data takes place
during or after the project, unless this is not possible
for security or privacy reasons.

If you as a local government have not collected the
data yourself, then you can determine together with

the initiative whether they can be published on the
platform of the city or town.

You can read about sharing data correctly in the
[Citizen Science Data Charter and in the Open Data](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

[Charter.](https://smart.flanders.be/open-data-charter/)

###### Step 20: Evaluate your project
In this step, you revisit the initial use case that you
described at the start of the project. In doing so, you
evaluate the success factors and pitfalls that you

encountered along the way: what went well, what
could be improved?

It is best to do an evaluation with the entire project
team. Involve everyone and reflect on the project

objectives and the results achieved. You can also draw
up a number of indicators that you will test. These

can be both qualitative and quantitative indicators.

For example: how many people did we reach with
the project? How much data did we collect? If your

objective was to raise awareness, you can also look at
the actual impact in terms of knowledge or behaviour

about a particular theme.

Citizen science by and with local governments is

still an emerging practice. Your project-based and

research-based conclusions are extremely valuable to

share with others.

###### Phase 5: Valorise

This is a final, crucial phase for local governments. In

this phase, the results are translated into concrete

policy actions.

###### Step 21: Translate insights into policy action
If your citizen science project aimed to use the
collected data for policy, this is the phase where

the local administration moves forward with

concrete action. Based on the results, the local

administration will actively use the data for advice,
adjustments to policy, or evaluation of measures
and implementations. If you do this right, then you
can speak of a data-driven policy. Ideally, the local
government also reuses or combines data for other

use cases. Indeed, experience shows that data can be
useful for different services or challenges, even where

one does not expect it.

Some examples where citizen science data can lead to

concrete policy actions:
_T adjusting circulation plans in certain_
neighbourhoods, based on traffic counts;
_T adjusting plans for public space and planting_
additional trees, based on data from local

monitoring stations and data on heat stress;
_T adjusting the mobility plan by building a bicycle_
street, based on air quality measurements;
_T using citizen science data to shape future policy_
plans, such as cutting car traffic in half and doubling
bicycle traffic, and to support arguments in

doing so.


###### Step 22: Develop a long-term plan
If the local government is eager to develop a longterm vision for a citizen science project, you will now
consider the following questions:
_T Will we repeat this project annually?_
_T Should we develop a follow-up project with_
a different focus?

_T How can we keep the project alive within_
the community?
_T Can we link the project to other projects?_
_T Who will take on future maintenance of_
the sensors?

It is not necessary to write a long-term plan for a
citizen science project. A one-off initiative can be
sufficient. The advantage of writing out a vision for

the long term is that projects are better aligned,
expertise from multiple services is bundled and there

is a constructive collaboration between knowledge

institutions and citizens.

## Citizen science equals collaboration

-----

Citizen science involves, without exception,

collaboration. In this chapter, we will elaborate on how

to find partners and set up collaborations.

###### Who is involved in citizen science projects?

In citizen science projects, we often see collaboration
between actors from the ‘social pentagon’. The
following examples of organizations were collected

during the workshops we held with local governments

and citizen science projects.

_T_ Civil society: these are citizens, action groups,

civic associations and other (voluntary) societies

where citizen science actors can be recruited

through a membership base. For example:

Stadslab 2050, Gents Milieufront, Filter Café Filtré,

Beweging.net, Histories vzw, VELT vzw, Avansa,

Mintus, ...;

_T_ Knowledge institutions: these are research and

science institutions, schools, (vocational) univer
sities and educational associations. For example:
Ghent University, Luca School of Arts, Plantentuin

Meise, Instituut voor Natuur- en Bosonderzoek

(INBO), VITO, imec, ...;

_T_ Governments: these are local and supra-local

authorities, and other public organizations.


For example: local governments, the provincial

government, Intercommunale Leiedal, the Vlaamse
Milieumaatschappij (VMM), the Government of
Flanders, Geopunt Vlaanderen, ...;

_T_ Industry: these are private companies with

expertise in certain types of sensors, in
building platforms, legal or judicial advice, data

management, communication and media, ... For

example: District09, Digipolis Antwerpen, Bits

of Love, law firm De Groote - De Man, Breeze

Technologies, EOS Wetenschap, Voices that Count,

De Standaard, Cronos, ....;

_T_ Financial world: there are Flemish, national or

European institutions that provide funding or
launch grant calls for citizen science. For example:
the Flemish Department of Economics, Science
and Innovation (EWI), the Fonds Wetenschappelijk
Onderzoek (FWO), European Commission 
Horizon Europe, ...;

However, this categorization is not exclusive. Certain
organizations can fall under several categories.

Research institutions can, at the same time, be

governmental bodies, such as the Flemish Institute
for the Sea (VLIZ). Likewise, a voluntary association

can also commit to educational tasks, like Natuurpunt
does. Similarly, the social services of a local
government can help search for specific groups of

participants.


52


-----

###### Who does what?

In a citizen science project, you can compose a
project team based on several elements. First of all,
you can opt for an interdisciplinary team. You can
combine different scientific disciplines, like various
research groups from different faculties, but you can
also work together with different actors from the

social pentagon. Furthermore, you could consider the

required competencies, the range in target groups
and the win-win situation you aim to create for

each group.

Considering the required competencies, you can
address specific actors. You can look for these

competencies within your local government,

outsource them to a company or choose a project
partner from civil society such as a volunteer

association. The activities with the most influence

on the project results are best set up in a shared

responsibility with civil society or, when you are the
initiator of a project, taken on by the government
itself. For example, formulating a problem statement

can be done in consultation with civil society. This
way, you can set up the project co-creatively from

the outset. For sharing data and monitoring privacy

and ethical guidelines, it is better to appoint one

responsible person.

######  We must get rid of the idea that we, as a local government, must do everything ourselves; we do not have the capacity nor the resources. Citizens can do something themselves in their garden and then you can include this. Citizens can do more than you think.”

If you as a local government take on the role of a
‘broker’, then you can suggest a number of partner
organizations. You pass on a number of contacts

to the citizen science initiative, and you could also

introduce these parties to each other.


Here, the government has a facilitating role in
bringing different parties together.

Possible competencies that can be useful in a citizen

science project:

_T_ Project coordination: monitoring the project plan,

formulating a problem statement,

logistical support, ...;
_T_ Formulating the problem statement: formulating

the research question or collecting ideas

or challenges;
_T_ Communication: recruiting participants,

publicizing the project, engaging volunteers,

valorising the results, ...;

_T_ Ethical and legal advice: guidelines on data

and ethics in citizen science;

_T_ Research: defining the research method,

analysis and interpretation of the data, ...;

_T_ Technology: determining data and technological

requirements, such as sensors, measuring devices,
platforms, ...;
_T etc._

As we learn from experience, actors find each other
mainly through informal contacts or through interme[diaries. The Scivil network can be a good starting point.](https://www.scivil.be/en/partners)


53


-----

###### A successful partnership

In order to have a successful partnership, there has

to be added value for the various actors involved.

The following points of interest can help you set up a
successful partnership:

_T_ Communicate clearly and openly:  make clear

agreements about the collaboration and create

clear expectations among partners and citizen
scientists. Even if you as a local government

###### Stiemerlab in Genk

For a city administration or a project partner, it
is a great advantage if a citizen science project
is part of a larger whole. For the city of Genk,
[the Stiemerlab project is not only a ‘measuring](https://stiemerlab.be/)
project of the scientific partners’, but it is also a

shared project supported by the whole city. The

project aligns with the city’s wish to restore the

health of the Stiemerbeek river and to stimulate

a sense of belonging among the citizens. Such a
framework helps a project to grow in the future.


###### The ‘Grote Schelpenteldag’ 
[VLIZ’s ‘Grote Schelpenteldag’ (Big Shell](http://www.vliz.be/en/event/2021-big-shell-counting-day)
Counting Day) is an annual event involving 10

coastal cities and towns. They know what is
expected of them each year, how it is organized
and what the project is about. Communications

regarding this event are prepared in advance by

VLIZ, so that the cities and towns can distribute

the right information via their newsletters or

local magazines in a timely manner and so that

communication is streamlined. For coastal

mayors it is attractive to support a beach

project, on the one hand because it can attract

more tourists to the coast, and on the other

hand because it can bring more awareness to
the people about the importance of the sea and
sea life, for our daily lives.

## A tale for techies? Data and measuring instruments

###### Citizen science also has a “technical” dimension. In this chapter, we will talk about data (protocols) and measurement equipment.


-----

Citizen science also has a “technical” dimension. In

this chapter we will talk about data (protocols) and

measurement equipment.

###### Data

An important advantage of citizen science is the
amount of new data you can collect. ‘To measure is

to know’ and citizens can be a great help. It allows

you to take measurements on private property, or in
places where specific professions or hobbyists go, like

fishermen. You can also save a lot of time if citizens

collect the data themselves.

However, the same data can also be the cause of

worry. The collection, analysis and interpretation
of data can sometimes go wrong. With appropriate

planning and actions, you can solve many


uncertainties and avoid pitfalls, so that your citizen

science project is truly valuable.

###### Questions and doubts about data

Sometimes, suspicions arise regarding citizen

science data. Are citizen scientists reliable or can

they intentionally or unintentionally influence the
results of a study? What exactly is being measured
and has this been carried out correctly? Are the data
processed and interpreted correctly? What do you do
with multiple conflicting interpretations?

Both research institutions and local administrations

face these questions, but they can be resolved with

appropriate measures. In this chapter, we provide
guidelines for dealing with data appropriately. Reliable
data are ultimately the core of a good citizen science

project.

###### Making agreements about data
Do you want to make agreements about data? Then

several aspects need to be taken into account: quality,

ownership, privacy, public availability, exchangeability
(also called ‘interoperability*’, meaning that data from
projects can be easily linked), etc.

In order to introduce initiators of citizen science

[projects to these aspects, the Scivil Data Working](https://www.scivil.be/en)


Group drew up a Flemish charter for data in citizen

[science. This charter is non-binding, but highly](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)
recommended. It consists of 26 principles divided into
five categories:

- Products, systems or organizations are interoperable if they can work

together without restrictions. To achieve this, standards, protocols and
procedures are required. We distinguish ‘semantic’ (definitions of data
concepts), ‘technical’ (technical guidelines), ‘organizational’ and ‘legal’
[interoperability. (Definition according to Wikipedia and VLOCA).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability)

[The charter not only makes recommendations, but](https://www.scivil.be/sites/default/files/paragraph/files/2021-04/Datacharter_voor_CitizenScience_v1_0.pdf)

[also comes with an extensive manual with tips and](https://www.scivil.be/sites/default/files/paragraph/files/2021-04/Datacharter%20Citizen%20Science%20-%20Leidraad-compressed.pdf)

practical examples to make it easier to apply the 26

principles.

We will elaborate on the most important principles
from the charter, using the concept ‘data quality’.


With this concept, we refer to the reliability of data,

but we also consider how correctly they are shared,
both on the technical level and in terms of ownership.

These aspects are particularly important in the

context of citizen science.


59


-----

###### Quality: are data from citizen science initiatives reliable?

Strictly speaking, ‘quality’ refers to the correctness,
accuracy and completeness of data. This is addressed
[in principle 15 of the citizen science Data Charter.](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

In a broader sense, the term ‘quality’ also covers

matters such as the correct organization, storage
and release of your data, both technically and legally.

[These aspects are also covered in the charter, and](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)
are briefly explained below, because they are of great

importance in citizen science.

###### Requirements?
In general, the quality of your data should at least
allow you to answer the research question of your
project in a statistically significant way. Ideally,

your data are also well documented and technically

arranged so that they can be linked to other project

data (see section ‘Findable and combinable’).

###### How?

The reliability of information and data is crucial to
the credibility of citizen science. There are different

ways to achieve this, but you will always have to make

a conscious trade-off between different methods:

do you want a large number of participants or rather
a small number of highly specialized participants?

Do you invest extra time to train them better or
do you provide simplified measurement methods
(‘protocols’) that you can distribute more widely?

In order to make that choice, it is best to take into

account the context and the overarching objectives
of your project: how important is data quality to you
compared to, for example, the educational content
of your project? In any case, you will always have
to find a balance between individual data quality on
the one hand, and scaling up to larger amounts of

observations/measurements on the other.

In any case, make sure you have well-tuned methods

or protocols: try to assess in advance, via a small pilot

study, what the possible errors could be, so that you

can anticipate these errors in your protocol. To do

this, it is best to take into account the background


of your (intended) participants and their knowledge

about the subject. The data must be interesting, but

the measurement or sampling methods must also be
practicable for the participants.

In general, you can focus on the following aspects:

You pay extra attention to training the

citizen scientists, so that they can make more

accurate observations or work more independently.

For example, you can provide extra manuals, an

extensive website or a teaching package, multiple

contact moments or extra guidance by ‘ambassadors’
from your field (see chapter 4). For example, in the

[MamaMito project, in which participants reconstructed](https://historiesvzw.be/projecten/mamamito/)
a family tree along their mother’s line, they put a lot of
effort in training citizen scientists through workshops

and an online guide. To this end, a collaboration was set
up with Familiekunde Vlaanderen, Davidsfonds, and a

number of small local historical societies.

You invest in data validation: you work

together with scientists or with the
aforementioned ‘ambassadors’, so that they can

check and validate the work of citizen scientists.

[On the DoeDat platform of the Plantentuin Meise,](https://www.doedat.be/?lang=en_US)

the scientists themselves validate the data that are

entered, and they still consider this way of working
to be more efficient than when they make their
observations without the help of citizens.

You ensure a very large number of samples,

measurements or observations by involving a
large number of participants in your project. In doing
so, you can either choose for a maximum number
of participants or a smaller group doing multiple
observations or measurements. The advantage of a
large number of participants is that you collect a large
amount of data on which you can make statistical

corrections afterwards.

Another advantage of ‘large numbers’ is that
different participants can double (duplicate)

certain observations, measurements or analyses,
thus checking the accuracy of their results.

[In a project like CurieuzeNeuzen (Curious Noses),](https://2018.curieuzeneuzen.be/vlaanderen-2018/in-english/)
which mapped the NO₂ concentrations* in Flanders
for the month of May 2019, there is a clear choice for
the power of numbers: 20,000 participants provided
a particularly large number of measuring points.

On the other hand, detailed measurements with

sensors were not possible for all those participants,
for reasons of feasibility. However, the NO₂ was
measured twice for each participant, via two

measuring tubes that were installed at the same time.

If those measurements did not match, then one of the

two was definitely wrong, and the entire sample (i.e.,
the two values) was excluded from the final data set,

because it was ‘not sufficiently reliable’.

In a similar way, many projects on the citizen science
[platform Zooniverse.org duplicate observations.](https://www.zooniverse.org/)
[One example is the Radio Meteor Zoo project of the](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/radio-meteor-zoo)
Belgian Instituut voor Ruimte Aeronomie (BIRA). In

this project, participants are asked to draw rectangles

as small as possible around signals indicating the
presence of meteors (usually visible as a vertical
line) on a spectrogram. In a preliminary study, 35

people were asked to draw rectangles on at least 12
different spectrograms. They were allowed to draw
intentionally incorrect rectangles. Afterwards, a

check was carried out to see how much the rectangles
of the different participants differed in size and

position. It was decided that each spectrogram
would be analysed by 10 different people, and that all
“space” indicated by at least four participants would
be used as the “smallest frame” of a meteor signal.

Apart from these methods, it is also best to
carefully select the citizens that will participate
in your project and/or to select the areas or time

periods in which they will make observations. It is
often necessary to systematically divide an area into

segments, so that global statements can be made.

Likewise, you need to make a conscious decision
whether to limit your observations to, for instance, a

season or the entire year.

[Spinicornis, the Belgian working group for woodlice,](https://www.spinicornis.be/)
wanted to map the distribution of woodlice in
Belgium. To do this, they divided the territory of
Belgium into segments of 10x10 kilometres, where


they organized field trips to each of those segments
for more than a year. The Spinicornis volunteers made
observations in different habitats (e.g., in a forest, in
a residential area, near a river) and over the course

of a whole year, in order to systematically cover all

seasons.

Who is responsible?

As a local government, you do not always have inhouse experts to guarantee reliable data quality for

all citizen science projects you participate in, or to
determine the technical requirements of the software
and hardware you use (e.g., sensors) (see Chapter 4).

Moreover, this also depends on the role that you as
a government take within a project (see chapter 3).

Make sure that you always have a project partner with
specialists in the field to help monitor the correctness
of the methodology. These do not necessarily have to
be professional scientists, but they should be people
with a thorough knowledge of the research field and

methods. It is necessary, however, that these experts

remain in contact with citizens, in order to monitor

the accessibility of the protocols.


[In the Leuven.cool project, weather stations](https://www.leuven.cool/)

were placed in public spaces and private
gardens to study the urban heat island effect.

This was done in collaboration with KU Leuven

and the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI).

There is also a link with the citizen science
[platform ‘Mijn Tuinlab’.](https://mijntuinlab.be/)


If you, as a local government, want to support a

project indirectly, you can opt to include quality

conditions in a bilateral contract, based on the

[principles of the Data Charter of Scivil. This charter is](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)
not binding, but can be a good guideline for evaluating

external offers.

*NO₂ or nitrogen dioxide is a gas that is released into the atmosphere from all
kinds of combustion processes, such as in a car engine, in boilers, in industry
or in power plants. 61% of NO₂ emissions in Flanders come from traffic, one of

the biggest causes of air pollution. This makes NO2 an important indicator of
[air pollution from traffic. (Definition taken from CurieuzeNeuzen).](https://2018.curieuzeneuzen.be/vlaanderen-2018/over-luchtkwaliteit/we-meten-no2/)


61


-----

###### Ownership & public availability: from and for whom are the data?

Before the start of your project, you should already

think about the conditions under which you will make
the data available to third parties. Communicate
clearly about possible intellectual property rights (see
[Principle 9 in the Scivil Data Charter) and possible](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

conditions under which third parties may reuse the

project data.

In general, the goal is to publish project data as openly

as possible. Most citizen science projects do this

[under a Creative Commons license or an Open Data](https://creativecommons.org/licenses)
[Commons license (see Principle 2 of the Scivil Data](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

[Charter).](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

For each project, do check beforehand whether the

[data does not fall under the Public Sector Information](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/organisatie/informatiemanagement/omzetting-psi-richtlijn)

[directive: in that case, use either a CC0 declaration,](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/organisatie/informatiemanagement/omzetting-psi-richtlijn)

[or the Model License ‘Gratis Hergebruik’, or the](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/sites/default/files/documenten/ict-egov/licenties/hergebruik/modellicentie_gratis_hergebruik_v1_0.html)

[Model License ‘Hergebruik tegen Vergoeding’. More](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/sites/default/files/documenten/ict-egov/licenties/modellicentie_hergebruik_tegen_vergoeding_v1_0.html)

[found on the website of Digitaal Vlaanderen.](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/organisatie/informatiemanagement/omzetting-psi-richtlijn)

###### Findable and linkable: avoid double work by joining forces 
International research policy and the European and

Flemish governments are strongly committed to
making data findable, sharable and interoperable.
You have to go through a number of logical steps to

achieve this. First, your data must be ‘open’


(see ‘Ownership & Public Availability’) and published
online. Preferably, you choose a data format that is

open and machine-readable. In other words: do not
choose a format that can only be read by a limited
number of programs or apps, such as .XLSX for
Microsoft Excel, or .SHP for ESRI geodata.
You choose formats that can be universally imported
by any program, such as .CSV instead of .XLSX, or
.GML for spatial data (see also principle 18 in the

[Data Charter).](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

For those with knowledge of data management,

we recommend reading and applying the technical
section of the Data Charter (principle 17 and
following) for citizen science. The Government of
Flanders provides a series of data standards for

different domains, which, in combination with data

standards from the scientific world, can form a

perfect set for your project. The most important data

[standards, such as those of OSLO, are mentioned](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/oslo-wat-is-oslo)

[in the Scivil Data Charter. For the topics ‘water in](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)

Ghent, including the development of the City’s Open Data Portal.

[Communicating ownership: The City of Ghent is very clear on its Open Data Platform about who is the](https://data.stad.gent/explore/?sort=modified&disjunctive.theme&disjunctive.keyword)
publisher of the datasets released on the platform, and which license is used.

in .CSV, .JSON and GeoJSON formats, among others.

###### Tools

Managing data in a citizen science project can be

divided into several steps: data collection, storage,
processing, and visualization. We highlight some of

the tools that are related to these steps.

###### Data collection: new data

When citizens help in the data collection phase,

they directly provide new data. This can be done via

sensors, an app or even using pen and paper. The

latter method can sometimes be the best solution,

for example, when automated observations pose

privacy concerns. Think about registering vehicles

and passersby on a street.

Some citizen science initiatives use apps to make it
[easier for their participants: ObsIdentify allows users](https://www.natuurpunt.be/nieuws/natuurherkenner-je-broekzak-met-de-app-obsidentify-20200326)
to take pictures of organisms, such as plants, animals
and fungi, which the application then automatically

[recognizes and adds to the Waarnemingen.be](https://waarnemingen.be/)
database. Another example of such a citizen science
[application is the (international) Marine Debris tracker](https://debristracker.org/)
app, in which you can enter every piece of litter you

come across.


The most advanced measurement technology

involves sensors: there are hundreds of different

types available and it is often difficult to see the
wood for the trees. There are sensors in all price
ranges, from simple devices costing a few euros to
professional setups costing thousands of euros.
So, it is best to first ask yourself what a sensor must

be able to measure - and with what precision and
accuracy - in order to solve your scientific problem.

Again, you have to weigh up data quality, price,
feasibility and data quantity. Various institutes,

such as imec and VMM, are working on methods
to calibrate low-cost sensors using professional

measuring equipment. The Telraam project recently
tested the performance of the sensors against a
police sensor and found a 10% margin of error.

For an extensive list of sensors for citizen science

[projects, we refer to the PWC study on the subject.](https://smart.flanders.be/smart-flanders-2.0/citizen-science)
Do not forget to pay attention to the durability
of a sensor, the required weather resistance and

maintenance efforts, after the sensor is installed.


64


-----

###### Reusing data: data sources
It is not necessary to collect all data by yourself:

more and more data are available online under an

[open license. On the metadata portal of Digitaal](https://metadata.vlaanderen.be/srv/dut/catalog.search#/home)
Vlaanderen, you can search for data that is relevant to
you. You can combine several parameters (e.g., ‘data
provider’ or ‘type of license’ or ‘year’) to quickly find
the dataset that is useful to you.

Are you looking for information on a specific research
[domain? Then have a look at the FRIS research portal:](https://www.researchportal.be/en)
here you can find out which research is carried out
by whom and which publications result from it. Soon,
information on scientific datasets (open or otherwise)

will also be available here.

Besides the metadata portals you can also go
[directly to Vlaams Open Dataportaal to look for](https://opendata.vlaanderen.be/)
[data. On Geopunt-Vlaanderen, you can easily see all](http://www.geopunt.be/catalogus/applicationfolder/new%20application)
available (open) data in a map environment. Research

institutions such as Instituut voor Natuur- en

Bosonderzoek (INBO) link their open data to Geopunt
and feed the portal. Local governments sometimes
[also offer open data, such as the City of Ghent or](https://data.stad.gent/explore/?sort=modified&disjunctive.theme&disjunctive.keyword)
[the City of Kortrijk. At the federal level, there are the](https://www.kortrijk.be/smart-cities)
[portals of the Belgian Open Data Initiative, and the](https://data.gov.be/nl)
[geoportal Geo.be, which includes data on air quality.](https://www.geo.be/home?l=en)

You might sometimes get lost in the “maze of

data”. Platforms to assemble and view data are

expensive, especially when it comes to real-time
data. Combining data from different tools is also

a challenge, in which most governments are still
finding their way. An important piece of advice is
that even if your city or town does not yet have its
own data platform, you should still look up what data
standards and formats are appropriate and feasible
for your project. The more your data comply with the
[principles of the Scivil Data Charter, the easier it will](https://www.scivil.be/book/datacharter-en-gids-voor-citizen-science)
be in the future to link your datasets to datasets and
databases of larger cities and towns, and those of

Digitaal Vlaanderen.

You will save a lot of money and effort, if you

collaborate with other cities and towns in setting
up technical structures such as a (real-time) data
platform. The cities of Leuven, Roeselare and Bruges
recently joined forces to launch a public contract to


select a Smart City Data platform. Bruges wants to

###### Data processing by citizens
Not all citizen science projects rely on direct
observations or sensor data. A large proportion of
[projects, such as those on the platforms Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/)
[and Velehanden.nl, offer a range of raw data and ask](https://velehanden.nl/)
citizens to analyse those data. This often involves
analysing images or texts. Examples of such projects
[are Radio Meteor Zoo, Oog voor Diabetes, and S.O.S.](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/radio-meteor-zoo)

[Antwerpen. With online tools like these, you make](https://sosantwerpen.be/)
use of the software behind the platforms. You offer
your collection or data and remain the owner of
those data afterwards. The results of the analyses of

citizen scientists are then delivered to you by these
platforms in an open format (e.g. .CSV). It is then up
to you what you do with it afterwards. However, in the
description of your project you should clearly state

who is processing the data, how this is done, and what

precautions you are taking to comply with

GDPR rules.


###### Data interpretation
In order to process data in a statistically correct way

and to interpret project results, you best consult
a professional. This does not always have to be an

academic, but involving scientists can be a great

advantage. Local governments or citizen science
projects often collaborate with nearby (vocational)

universities. Some cities or towns see it as their

task to do the interpretation of the data themselves

in projects they initiate or lead themselves.

Nevertheless, it remains advisable to involve other

actors (such as scientists and citizens) in this step of

your project as well. This can also have advantages

for clear, neutral communication. Do not be afraid to

link the data back to the citizens themselves in this

phase: they have their own perspective or context
from which they can contribute, and it can also

encourage them to engage more or in the long term.
[The city of Mechelen (Meet Mee Mechelen) provides a](https://mechelen.meetmee.be/c/Mechelen-in-Kaart-Geef-%20je-%20mening/)
good example of interaction with citizens in terms of

[the measurement data on their website.](https://mechelen.meetmee.be/c/Mechelen-in-Kaart-Geef-%20je-%20mening/)


-----

###### Sharing data
[You can share your data on Geopunt-Vlaanderen (see](http://www.geopunt.be/catalogus/applicationfolder/new%20application)
also ‘Reusing data’), where you can also find a large
number of (open) data. If you cannot place your citizen

science data in a spatial context, then you can describe
your data properly (via metadata) and link them to the
[metadata portal of Digitaal Vlaanderen. This way, they](https://metadata.vlaanderen.be/srv/dut/catalog.search#/home)
can still be found by anyone who wants to build on your

research. For the arts and heritage sector, check out all

Whether or not it is the responsibility of a local

government to provide open and linked data,

depends a lot on the government and the project

itself. Is the city or town the initiator of the project?

Then it seems logical that the government provides

in a data infrastructure. Does the initiative come from

partners, or do partners already have an existing data
infrastructure? Then you can consult and make clear

agreements in advance about who will take on what

role. Also bear in mind that sometimes data cannot be

shared for legal reasons.

Before you decide as a city council to capture data,
you should ask yourself how interesting or necessary
the project is, and how easy it is to get hold of the
data if you do not store it in your own infrastructure.

Also, when jointly purchasing sensors, it is best
to agree in advance who, for example, will do the
maintenance of the sensors, if something goes wrong

or when the sensors need to be replaced.

Finally, it is worth to stay informed about the Flemish
[government’s Open Data Policy. Through the Open](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/producten-diensten/open-data)
Data Action Plan (2020-2024), the government
is taking actions to maximize the findability and
interoperability of data in Flanders.

to project. Personnel costs are usually not too

on staff funded through other channels (researchers, staffing,...), cities and towns can also offer financial

###### Flemish and European funding

Citizen science also receives support from the

Government of Flanders and the European
Commission, sometimes directly (as illustrated by the
EWI calls below), usually as part of a larger project.

_T_ [Calls from the Department of Economics, Science](https://www.ewi-vlaanderen.be/oproep-citizen-science)

and Innovation (EWI). Between 2017 and 2021, the

Department of Economics, Science and Innovation

of the Government of Flanders supported 20
citizen science projects for a total budget

of € 2.900.000:

    - Following a call in December 2017, Minister

Muyters supported seven citizen science
projects for € 1,000,000 in May 2018 and six
additional projects for € 900,000 in a second

wave.

    - In 2019, there was a second call for citizen

science projects from the EWI Department.

Seven projects were supported for a total of

€ 1,000,000.

T European funds. The European priorities for

the coming years are summarized in the Green
Deal. Europe is going for an innovative economy,

climate neutrality and social justice. The European
funds are dedicated to projects that contribute

to these ambitions. Citizen science can take an

important place in these projects and contribute
both educationally and scientifically, in terms of
awareness-raising or as an added value for policy.

In the past, INTERREG Europe, INTERREG North
Sea Region and ERASMUS+ have already been
successfully used for citizen science. HORIZON is
also funding research projects on citizen science.

Here are some examples of citizen science projects
funded by Europe:

-----

We highlight a number of general points of interest
for successfully supporting or participating in citizen

science in your city or town. Looking at the interviews

and workshops we held with local governments and
citizen science projects, the following insights

stood out.

###### Scientific backing

While collaboration with a scientific institution is

not an absolute must for citizen science, it often

adds significant value to the research. The scientific
partners inject expert knowledge of the researched

domain and know the most reliable ways to collect or


interpret certain data. If the project team does not

yet have this expertise on board, the obvious solution
is to approach a (vocational) university or research

institute.

Scientists can also take on the role of neutral, objective

partner in a citizen science project and this can
certainly help to win the citizens’ trust for the project.

A partnership can only be successful if there is a
win-win situation for all partners involved. This is no

different in citizen science and scientific institutions.

Chapter 5 provides more information on what a

partnership in a citizen science project may entail.

-----

###### Activating and engaging citizens

Local governments are considered to be ideal

partners in citizen science initiatives, because they

have close ties with citizens, local associations and

key persons that can play a crucial role in recruiting
and keeping citizen scientists engaged. Seek out
groups of citizens who are already committed to
the topic, and involve them in the project. A club of
sport fishermen may want to contribute to the water

Keep in mind that citizen science most easily

reaches a certain target group and that this may
have implications for the representativeness of the
data you want to collect. For example, if you want to

map air pollution, you don’t want to do this only in

the neighbourhoods and streets where older, highly

educated people live.


quality. A social media page where people exchange

tips on ecological gardening, can quickly gather
enthusiastic participants for greening gardens.

The local heritage society will be very interested in

research on heritage within its community.

Most citizen science initiatives tend to attract a

homogeneous group of participants: the participants
are predominantly over fifty and are highly educated.
Sometimes the participants are also mostly male,
although this is not true for every project. A survey of

300 Flemish citizen scientists confirmed these trends.

Target groups that do not automatically find their

way to a citizen science project will have to be actively

approached. This is best done via ambassadors or

organizations that know these target groups well.

They can spread the news about the research among
their network. Concrete tips and tricks are provided

in chapter 5.

###### Expectation management

When a local government commits to a citizen science

initiative, it sends a signal to citizen scientists that

the government takes the research seriously. Among

citizen scientists, this will create expectations
that the local government will also take action if

this seems necessary or desirable according to the

research.

The residents of a city or town are not always fully
aware of how their government works. Therefore, the

government should clearly communicate the extent
of its commitment during and after the project.

_T In terms of time: it can take some time for a_
decision to pass through the entire policy cycle.
If actions by the government take a while as a

result, it may seem to citizen scientists that
the government disregarded the results of the
research. Therefore, keep them regularly informed
of what is being done with the research results.


_T In terms of scale: a local government does not have_
unlimited resources and it cannot carry out every
action that the citizen (scientist) requests. Again,
it is important for the government to explain from
the beginning what commitments for change it can
make. Be sure to keep citizen scientists informed of

what does happen with the research results.

###### Sustainability

Long-term projects can provide very valuable

insights, because the data reveal trends in the long
run. But the long duration of these projects comes

with additional risks and challenges.

Most citizen science projects see a large spike in

participation by citizen scientists at the beginning
of the project. In turn, keeping large numbers of

citizen scientists engaged throughout a long-term
project is a challenge in itself, requiring a specific

communication and participation strategy. To
[this end, you can find tips and tricks in the Scivil](https://www.scivil.be/en/book/communication-citizen-science)

[communication guide.](https://www.scivil.be/en/book/communication-citizen-science)

Especially in citizen science projects initiated by the
citizen community itself, the continuation of the
project often depends on one or a few enthusiastic
initiators. If they eventually drop out, the project

might come to a complete standstill. To cope with

this, the local administration can develop a ‘citizen
science community’, in which different projects and

organizations are interconnected.

Conversely, the initiators and collaborators of various

citizen science projects indicated during interviews
that interest and support for their research by local

government did not remain constant either.


Sometimes, there was a lot of enthusiasm to support

the project at its inception, and that interest waned

after a while. Sometimes, it was just the opposite

and there was suddenly more interest in the research
from local government. It was not always clear for the

projects what caused this change in support: a change
in personnel that prevented the official, who held the
project in high esteem, from continuing its support?
The news value of the project that suddenly increased
or decreased? A new alderman or mayor who
attached more or less value to citizen participation?

An established policy on citizen science in a city

or town can cope with these peaks and troughs in

interest for citizen science. Read more about it in

chapter 3.

###### Control

A local government can never fully control or manage

citizen science. A government may choose not to

support a citizen science project, but that does not

mean that the research will be discontinued. On

the other hand, not every citizen science initiative

wants to maintain a close partnership with their local

government.

Even when a city or town does contribute to citizen

science, unexpected and perhaps undesirable results
may emerge from the research. That possibility
should certainly be considered before a government

commits to citizen science.

In both cases, it is recommended that the

government does not disregard citizen science,

but that it openly communicates why it may or may
not commit to action. We provide concrete tips for

dealing with this in Chapter 3.

######  I sense quite a bit of distrust and fear of data. We’re often asked: “So will everyone get access to that?”, “Will it be proactively communicated?” Officials often have concerns about that as well. Maybe they’re afraid of the administration’s reaction afterwards.”

Gaining the trust of local government. Recognize

that what citizen scientists do, is done in a

scientifically sound way and that this data can be

valuable to governance and policy.

The research can create impact in the city or

town. Measures or adjustments are made by
or with the support of the local administration
to meet the research findings. Even if this
sometimes requires a lot of time.

Using the extensive network of the local
government to find partners or participants for

these efforts are recognized.

science projects. From the input of citizen science

project staff, we developed this wish list relative to

local governments.

This can be a message in the newsletter at the
launch of the project, or spreading the research

results via an interactive screen in front of the

town hall.


######  8


Citizen science projects sometimes experience
that interest or support from local government
for their research is temporary. They would

certainly welcome a policy strategy that could

guarantee some continuity.

More resources are welcome. Small-scale and

local citizen science projects indicate that limited
funding from the city or town could already help

a lot.

A local government can also help citizen science in
kind, by offering logistical and technical support,
like providing a venue for activities, offering data
infrastructure or technical support in building or

maintaining sensors.

###### Gezond Slotermee Health connects Amsterdam-Slotermeer

In 2014 and 2015, a group of Slotermeer residents

attended a training to become Health Ambassadors.

These residents interviewed their neighbours
about how healthy they think Slotermeer is in terms
of litter, exercise and sports, child-friendliness,
greenery in the neighbourhood, ambiance, traffic and
transportation, etc. They collected this information
from local residents and, in turn, gave them advice on

certain topics, such as moisture problems at home.

The ambassadors learned how to interview, gained

additional knowledge and started to think more
positively about the health of Slotermeer. Moreover,

the interviewers came into contact with people

outside their direct network. This way, talking about
health served a connecting function, crossing cultural

differences.

The results were presented during a health festival
for local residents and other interested parties. They
will also be used to complement existing scientific

insights and to better align policy with practice. A
total of 221 interviews were conducted by

22 ambassadors.

###### 'Active ageing' in the city
The "Manchester Aging Study" is an investigation
in the ways elderlies experience life in the city. The

project aimed to contribute to what the World Health
Organization (WHO) defines as 'active ageing',
namely continued participation in all aspects of social,
economic, cultural, spiritual and community life. The

study involved elderlies, not only as target population
of the study, but also as experts and actors in the

planning, design, development and implementation
of the study. A diverse group of eighteen elderly
residents, between the ages of 58 and 74, were

trained as co-researchers. The co-researchers

conducted 68 interviews with elderlies who were

experiencing social exclusion, isolation, poverty, or

health problems. Through the interviews, they sought
ways to improve the quality of life of elderlies in urban
communities. The insights from the interviews and
input from the co-researchers were used for the
redesign of a local park and the renewal of public

transport.

###### Stiemerlab

The sewage system and the increasing urban
expansion in Genk have a negative impact on the
water quality (pollution, algae formation) and
biodiversity of the brook Stiemerbeek (16 km long)
and Stiemerbeek Valley. The citizen science project
'Stiemerlab' starts from the premise that citizens of

Genk citizens, local residents and local organizations

can actively contribute to assess and address the

water quality issues. The project wants to actively
involve citizens, for example by training them as

citizen scientists to collect data on the water quality
in the Stiemerbeek using sensors. In addition, citizens

can also assess biological water quality by taking
water samples at various locations in the Stiemer

Valley.

The results will then be visualized in an accessible way

to a large audience in public spaces and on an open
online platform. The aim of this project is, on the one
hand, to monitor the water quality of the Stiemerbeek
over a long period of time and, on the other hand, to
gain insight into the recovering power of the brook

after overflows from sewers.

For the project, a unique partnership was formed

between LUCA School of Arts, VITO, UHasselt

(Centre for Environmental Sciences), the City of Genk


and Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij (VMM). The project
received support from the Government of Flanders,
Department of Economy, Science and Innovation

#### The authors


###### imec-SMIT, Vrije Universiteit Brussel
[The research group SMIT (Studies in Media,](https://smit.vub.ac.be/)
Information & Technology) is part of the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel and imec, and is specialized

in socio-economic research in the field of

digital innovation and media. Within the ‘data,
communities & governance’ unit of SMIT, expertise
has been built on the recruitment and engagement
of citizens in research, as well as the organization
of impact measurement and evaluation of citizen
science tools. SMIT is a partner in the following
citizen science projects: hackAIR, FloodCitiSense,
Oog voor Diabetes, the SBO project Flamenco,
Climate Stories and the amai!-project.

Carina Veeckman (senior researcher, Bachelor

& Master Communication Sciences, researcher
at SMIT) is a member of the working group
‘Communication and Participation’ and of the
steering committee of Scivil. Carina coordinated
the development of this roadmap.

Nils Walravens (senior researcher, PhD in

Communication Sciences) coordinated the Smart

Flanders program and was the promotor of this

project.

###### IDEA Consult

[The IDEA team is a partner of public and semi-](https://www.ideaconsult.be/en/)
public organizations that go for sustainable
development and impact. They provide new
insights, concepts, strategies and instruments
to innovate our economy and labour market (new
economy), increase the vitality of cities and regions
(vibrant places) and introduce more effective


governance practices (modern governance).
They deploy their expertise in a multidisciplinary
manner. This project on citizen science is a good

illustration of that.

Bart Van Herck is senior expert and managing
director of IDEA Consult. From his experience
with local government in Flanders, he worked on a
strategy to integrate citizen science more strongly
into the daily practice of cities and towns.

Marieke Carpentier is a researcher at IDEA and
conducted in-depth interviews with the pilot cities
in the project. These good practices were integrated
in this roadmap.

###### Scivil

In 2018, the Department of Economy, Science &
Innovation (EWI) of the Government of Flanders

launched a project call on citizen science. In
response to that call, the EWI Department
commissioned RVO Society to establish a citizen
[science knowledge centre. Scivil was founded in](https://www.scivil.be/en)
January 2019 as the Flemish Centre of Expertise
for Citizen Science, aiming to bundle and
strengthen the expertise on citizen science in
Flanders as a network organization.

Mieke Sterken en Jef Van Laer are citizen

science advisors at Scivil. Mieke coordinated the

Scivil working group ‘Data and citizen science’

in collaboration with Informatie Vlaanderen and

published the Flemish Data Charter for Citizen
Science. Jef organized a series of surveys,
interviews and focus groups in 2019 and 2020
to map the Flemish citizen science field.
