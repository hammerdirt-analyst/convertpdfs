17 **Abstract**

18 _Citizen science that is, involving the public in scientific inquiry has increased with an_

19 expected use in social decision-making as a democratized scientific method. Despite the

20 success of citizen science projects, such as enhancing the public understanding of science

21 and contributing to social well-being, the use of these projects in social decision-making

22 is constrained due to an inherent issue, namely, bias. A critical challenge lies in the limited

23 role of citizens in these projects, which impacts social decision-making. The

24 representativeness of participants is a concern, because projects frequently attract a

25 specific demographic, which can lead to results that are inapplicable to the broad

26 population. Other issues include geographical and temporal representativeness, as well as

27 the lack of accessibility and inclusion, which can exclude individuals without the

28 necessary resources for participation. Additionally, a superficial involvement of citizens

29 exists in the research process. Citizens are typically only involved in data collection and

30 occasionally analysis, which leaves the crucial stages of design and interpretation to

31 researchers. This scenario could also lead to results that are misaligned with community

32 needs or values, which, hence, limits a genuine contribution to democratic and socially

33 relevant decision-making. To realize the democratized scientific method, citizen science

34 needs to extend beyond mere data collection and engage citizens in all aspects of the

35 research process. By embracing these challenges, the future of citizen science could

36 significantly impact society.

41 **Introduction**

42 In recent years, scientific evidence is one of the key factors of social decision-making

43 (Lee 2010; Turner et al. 2022). Furthermore, the call for public involvement in social

44 decision-making, such as establishing policy in line with democratic ideals, has increased

45 (Rowe and Frewer 2000, 2005). Citizen science is typically heralded as a mechanism for

46 greater public engagement with scientific research (Hollow et al. 2015; Hecker et al.

47 2019). This view leads to the assertion that citizen science may foster public input into

48 social decision-making (Bonney et al. 2014; Hollow et al. 2015; Kobori 2022).

49 In fact, a number of previous studies suggested that citizen science projects can

50 contribute to social decision-making in various ways. For example, Hollow et al. (2015)

51 demonstrated that a citizen science project enabled the collection of a wide range of

52 opinions, which helped in the discovery and definition of relevant issues on management

53 and conservation policies for koalas (Hollow et al. 2015). Bonney (2016) cited that citizen

54 science can contribute to the public understanding of science and positively contribute to

55 social well-being (Bonney et al. 2016). Tiago (2017) mentioned that guiding policy goals

56 and decisions is one of the crucial factors of the appropriate design of citizen science

57 projects. Therefore, citizen science projects hold the potential to engage the public in

58 scientific research and contribute to social decision-making.

59 Scholars consider citizen science as a means of democratizing science and

60 enhancing public engagement (Bonney et al. 2016; Hecker et al. 2019). Indeed, it offers

61 significant potential in extending the reach and applicability of scientific research. To the

62 best of our knowledge, however, discussions on the challenges related to citizen science

63 for social decision-making remain few. Several studies have been conducted on the


-----

Osawa 4

64 challenges for citizen science, especially on various types of bias (Dickinson et al. 2010;

65 Sullivan et al. 2014; Kosmala et al. 2016). These issue also could limit its contribution to

66 social decision-making. Therefore, in this column, I intend to construct the relationship

67 between the challenges of citizen science and social decision-making. My contention is

68 that although citizen science poses clear advantages for societal decision-making, its

69 potential is more constrained than expected, which is mainly due to the essential

70 challenges of citizen science. By leveraging these advantages and overcoming these

71 challenges, citizen science holds the potential to significantly contribute to the process of

72 societal decision-making.

73

74 **Nature of citizen science and conflicts in democracy**

75 Public engagement is one of the essential points of citizen science projects (Hollow et al.

76 2015; Hecker et al. 2019). These projects can range from simple observational studies to

77 complex experimental designs; thus, they enable the public to contribute to various

78 scientific disciplines (Sullivan et al. 2014; Bonney et al. 2014). When this principle is

79 discussed along with democratic decision-making processes, one could infer that citizen

80 science is regarded as a potent facilitator of endeavors in societal decision-making.

81 However, the extent to which citizens can genuinely engage in the process significantly

82 varies. This limited role presents several implications for social decision-making.

83

84 _Bias and representativeness_

85 The first challenge is the representativeness of participants in citizen science projects (Fig.

86 1a). In this aspect, demographic representativeness becomes an issue if citizen science


-----

Osawa 5

87 projects attract participants mainly from specific age groups, socioeconomic backgrounds,

88 or levels of education (Hollow et al. 2015; Osawa 2018). This preference can lead to

89 results that are inapplicable to the broad population. Geographical representativeness

90 becomes a concern if projects attract participants from certain regions but not others,

91 which leads to geographically skewed data (van Strien et al. 2013). For example, urban

92 areas may be overrepresented, whereas rural or less accessible regions may be

93 underrepresented (Dickinson et al. 2010). Temporal representativeness may occur if data

94 collection is concentrated at specific times, such as weekends or holidays, because it may

95 inaccurately represent a phenomenon over time (Callaghan et al. 2019). Accessibility and

96 technology barriers could cause a lack of representativeness if a project requires specific

97 skills or technology, which excludes those without access to these resources (Osawa

98 2018). Essentially, participants in citizen science project are volunteers; thus, maintaining

99 representativeness for the target community may be difficult.

100

101 _Accessibility and inclusion_

102 Certain issues emerge even among participants in citizen science projects. Not all

103 individuals have equal access to participate in these projects (Fig. 1b). Individuals without

104 access to necessary technology, education, or other resources may be excluded, which

105 leads, once again, to potential bias and lack of representativeness (Osawa chapterX). The

106 majority of citizen science projects involve the public in data collection and, occasionally,

107 analysis. This contribution undoubtedly extends the reach of scientific research but

108 frequently fails to engage citizens in other stages of research such as design and

109 interpretation. Even in projects that claim to promote participatory science, researchers


-----

Osawa 6

110 predominantly lead the formulation of research questions, methodology, and analysis

111 (Dickinson et al. 2010). This scenario may reduce the ability of a project to reflect the

112 interests, values, and local knowledge of the public (Fig. 1c). The final points of the

113 results and their implications are typically dependent on researchers. This control may

114 undermine the potential of citizen science to genuinely contribute to social decisions that

115 align with the needs and perspectives of a community.

116

117 _Scientific accomplishments on citizen science projects_

118 Although citizen science projects could avoid or address bias using a circumspect design

119 (Callaghan et al. 2019), preventing the essential bias frequently caused by researchers is

120 difficulty. For this reason, scientific outputs are typically unable to reflect the collective

121 opinion of these projects. When publishing accomplishments, one or a few professional

122 researchers generally lead these projects (Fig. 1c). By maintaining control over study

123 design and interpretation, researchers may inadvertently impose their perspectives and

124 biases, which leads to results that are misaligned with the needs or values of the

125 community. Participants in citizen science projects may hold various expectations or

126 personal stakes in the research outcomes (Osawa chapterX). Thus, the superficial

127 involvement of citizens without genuine empowerment may reduce citizen science to

128 tokenistic participation, which undermines its potential to contribute to democratic

129 decision-making. In reality, however, managing these expectations and ensuring that

130 participants understand the objectives and limitations of these projects can be challenging.

131 In fact, Ecklund et al. (2012) demonstrate that researchers hold the perception that the

132 lack of scientific knowledge among citizens poses difficulty in communicating scientific


-----

Osawa 7

133 discoveries (Ecklund et al. 2012). The advancement of mutual understanding between

134 researchers and citizens (i.e., science communication is perceived as crucial for

135 addressing this issue) and the discussion on this point are, indeed, progressing (Ikkatai

136 Chapter X; Kuehne and Olden 2015; Kondo et al. 2019).

137

138 **Challenges of citizen science for social decision-making**

139 Although numerous citizen science studies have extensively noted these issues in bias,

140 the primary focus has predominantly been on data bias (Dickinson et al. 2010; Kosmala

141 et al. 2016) in which interpretative bias receives comparatively less discussion. Hence,

142 the question emerges: how should the outputs of citizen science be leveraged in the

143 context of societal decision-making?

144 Rigorous methodologies, extensive quality control, and in-depth analysis

145 frequently characterize traditional scientific projects for social decision-making, which

146 are typically conducted by professional scientists in the academic, governmental, and

147 industry settings. This process produces high-quality, peer-reviewed knowledge that

148 serves as a solid foundation for informed social decision-making. However, such projects

149 may not always reflect the diversity of community perspectives, may be limited by their

150 specific focus or availability of resources, and may oftentimes be disconnected from on
151 the-ground reality. Alternatively, citizen science projects are considered to engage the

152 public in scientific investigation, which offers an opportunity for increased community

153 participation and the collection of data at scales or resolutions that may be unfeasible for

154 professional scientists (Bonney et al. 2014; Callaghan et al. 2019). These projects can

155 capture a wide range of perspectives and foster public understanding and engagement in

Osawa 8

156 science. However, as previously discussed, the advantages attributed to citizen science

157 are not always guaranteed. Importantly, when scientists are largely involved in the

158 aggregation of collected data, the scientific achievements that can be garnered may not

159 necessarily be inferior to those of traditional science. Although both traditional and citizen

160 science projects approach discovery and understanding in distinct ways, they are united

161 in their shared pursuit of scientific knowledge and accomplishments. Additionally, they

162 share weak points such as difficulty in reflecting diverse perspectives and limitation in

163 resources. In summary, no essential differences exist between the two forms of science,

164 at least in terms of scientific accomplishment, which could contribute to social decision
165 making (Fig. 2).

166 Conversely, citizen science poses certain specific advantages. As widely

167 discussed, this aspect primarily involves the process in which stakeholders that is, the

168 citizens, are directly involved in problem-solving and issue identification. Despite various

169 expectations, the role of science is to provide objective responses. However, the direct

170 involvement of citizens in this process is a challenge for traditional science. In this respect,

171 the application of the outcomes of citizen science to societal decision-making could

172 potentially bear significance, because it realizes an endeavor that was previously

173 unattainable (Fig. 2). Thus, in social decision-making, recognizing the differences

174 between traditional and citizen science, instead of avoiding their dichotomization, would

175 be beneficial.

176 Social decision-making should be based on a comprehensive understanding that

177 includes the rigorous insights offered by the scientific method and the inclusive

178 perspectives provided by citizens. Notably, these two approaches can be complementary,


-----

Osawa 9

179 and integrating them can lead to more robust and inclusive decision-making processes.

180 From this perspective, citizen science possesses the potential to encompass the critical

181 components of societal decision-making (Fig. 2). However, realizing this potential will

182 likely be a significant challenge for citizen science in the future.

183

184 **Conclusion and perspective**

185 In conclusion, this column intends to make two assertions. First, no essential difference

186 exists between traditional and citizen science in terms of outcomes; accordingly, no

187 disparity exists in their contribution to societal decision-making. Second, citizen science

188 ensures an advantage in that it permits the participation of citizens in the knowledge

189 acquisition process and possesses the potential to encompass the critical components of

190 societal decision-making. To truly unlock the potential of citizen science in the formation

191 of social decisions, a radical rethinking of participation is required. This process entails

192 going beyond mere data collection to genuinely engaging citizens in all aspects of

193 scientific inquiry that is, from the formulation of a problem to the application of the result

194 as well as its interpretation and publication. Without this shift, citizen science will likely

195 remain an extension of professional scientific practice instead of a transformational force

196 for a more democratic, socially relevant decision-making.

197 Although citizen science offers a tantalizing prospect for bridging the gap

198 between scientific research and social decision-making, the existing practices and

199 paradigms frequently constrain its true potential. To transform citizen science into a

200 genuine force for democratic, socially relevant decision-making, a concerted effort must

201 be exerted to evolve beyond the current limitations. This aspect requires a reimagining of


-----

Osawa 10

202 participation, a commitment to genuine collaboration, and vigilant monitoring to ensure

203 that citizen science is not merely an extension of professional practice but a

204 transformative approach that genuinely includes and values the voices and contributions

205 of citizens. The future of citizen science lies in embracing these challenges, and, in so

206 doing, realizing its potential to impact not only science but also society as a whole.
